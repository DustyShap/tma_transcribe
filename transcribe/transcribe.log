[00:00.000 --> 00:02.160]  The choice of a lawyer is important and shouldn't be based on an ad.
[00:02.160 --> 00:06.000]  After a serious car accident, people have two questions.

[00:08.240 --> 00:11.600]  Well, no one knows why you, but I'm Terry Crouppen,

[00:30.960 --> 00:34.000]  Doug got unfortunately, we're short on time here.
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.440]  Yeah, I noted that too.
[00:36.240 --> 00:37.760]  And there's so much to get to.
[00:38.560 --> 00:40.000]  I mean, when I say so much,
[00:41.120 --> 00:42.720]  it's an accident to get down the hallway.
[00:42.720 --> 00:45.040]  That's our, so we do have a hard out.
[00:45.040 --> 00:48.400]  I also want to tell people about Muggadass St. Louis Acura in Alton, Toyota.
[00:48.400 --> 00:50.080]  Muggadass Berke in Alton, Toyota.
[00:50.080 --> 00:54.080]  online at stloseacura.com and altontoyota.com
[00:54.080 --> 00:56.720]  and the sponsor of the seven o'clock hour,
[00:51.040 --> 00:53.040]  Push a little daisies and make them come up.
[00:53.040 --> 00:57.040]  Push a little daisies and make them come up.
[00:57.040 --> 01:01.040]  Push a little daisies and make them come up.
[01:01.040 --> 01:07.040]  Sometimes I know, and sometimes I'm on the go.
[01:07.040 --> 01:13.040]  But I'm coming back, don't give me no flag, yeah.
[01:13.040 --> 01:19.040]  It's all you, it's me too.
[00:51.040 --> 01:00.000]  Welcome friends to the Munginass, St. Louis, Acura, Alton, Toyota, 7 o'clock hour.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.840]  Timothy Michael McCurnan, Douglas Elvin Vaughn, Kenneth Higgistro, the plow-hawk in action,
[01:03.840 --> 01:09.840]  Jackson with you on the radio program. Doug, a couple of things of note here.
[01:10.720 --> 01:14.320]  When I opened up the YouTube chat, it's wonderful to see the people gathering,
[01:15.280 --> 01:22.160]  talk it over in there, an ad for Saks Fifth Avenue played. And I kind of think that finally,
[01:22.160 --> 01:29.040]  we finally have hit the perfect demographic for what the content of the show is. And that is the
[01:29.040 --> 01:36.320]  Saks Fifth Avenue client base. Every time I'm in Saks, playing jewels, I see a number of listeners.
[01:36.320 --> 01:39.760]  But isn't Mr. Licks like a customer representative there? So maybe that...
[01:39.760 --> 01:42.640]  Oh, is that the deal? Yeah, he's a rep there. So I think
[01:19.040 --> 01:25.040]  It's a world, it's a girl, it's a girl.
[01:25.040 --> 01:27.040]  You can do a mashup, look at that.
[01:27.040 --> 01:29.040]  Just look at that.
[01:29.040 --> 01:31.040]  That's a little similarity.
[01:31.040 --> 01:37.040]  Welcome back, this program is called The Morning After. It's unbelievable.
[01:37.040 --> 01:41.040]  It really is. It really, really is. And it's presented by Brown and Crouppen.
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.040]  Is that it's still on the air?
[01:43.040 --> 01:45.040]  It is pretty surprising.
[01:45.040 --> 01:47.040]  People are surprised at all.
[00:56.720 --> 01:00.320]  official automotive provider of TMA and just good people.
[01:00.320 --> 01:01.040]  That's it.
[01:01.040 --> 01:02.560]  Good people looking for a car.
[01:02.560 --> 01:03.760]  Why don't we deal with the good people?
[01:03.760 --> 01:04.400]  How about that?
[01:04.400 --> 01:05.440]  Jamie Burcard.
[01:05.440 --> 01:07.200]  I would suggest that Toyota Highlander.
[01:07.200 --> 01:08.000]  They've got me driving.
[01:08.000 --> 01:08.480]  Yeah, you like that?
[01:08.480 --> 01:09.520]  Such a great SUV.
[01:09.520 --> 01:10.400]  Yeah.
[01:10.400 --> 01:13.840]  It's really the information center really easy to operate.
[01:14.480 --> 01:15.920]  Some of them now are very complicated.
[01:15.920 --> 01:16.960]  This is easy to operate.
[01:17.600 --> 01:20.240]  Got a big wide rear view screen.
[01:20.240 --> 01:20.880]  No.
[01:20.880 --> 01:21.760]  Rear view camera.
[01:21.760 --> 01:24.160]  I can see two or three doors down when I back out of my driveway.
[01:24.160 --> 01:25.600]  I don't even have to turn around and look anymore.
[01:25.600 --> 01:26.400]  I got such a great view.
[01:47.040 --> 01:53.040]  Make a little vulture sponsor of the studio's 2.6 grams of carbohydrates, 95 calories.
[01:53.040 --> 01:57.040]  And settle in and enjoy a few this holiday season.
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.040]  Doug, it's holiday time. What are you looking forward to this holiday season?
[02:02.040 --> 02:04.040]  I would imagine meeting your new grandson.
[02:04.040 --> 02:06.040]  You get to meet him today.
[02:06.040 --> 02:07.040]  That's today.
[02:07.040 --> 02:09.040]  That's awesome. What a great thing. God bless America.
[02:09.040 --> 02:11.040]  When I talked to you, I thought it wasn't going to be after the holidays.
[02:11.040 --> 02:14.040]  Was that the expectation? Was it post-Christmas?
[01:26.480 --> 01:26.800]  Look at that.
[01:26.800 --> 01:27.200]  This camera.
[01:27.760 --> 01:28.000]  Yeah.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  I run over a garbage can or something.
[01:30.000 --> 01:30.960]  That's on me.
[01:30.960 --> 01:34.320]  But I can see cars coming from the long way away, which helps.
[01:34.320 --> 01:36.240]  They just do great work.
[01:36.240 --> 01:39.520]  And we are really pleased to have a partnership with a place,
[01:39.520 --> 01:42.240]  the caliber of MongoDass St. Louis Acura,
[01:42.240 --> 01:43.920]  MongoDass Berke, Alton, Toyota.
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.000]  Online at stloseacura.com and altontoyota.com.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  If you are in the market for a home,
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.560]  you can work with the great Jeff Lottman of Compass Realty St. Louis.
[01:43.280 --> 01:47.920]  that may be why the algorithm hit that way. I think Jeff Avelin used to work there.
[01:47.920 --> 01:50.080]  Oh, you didn't do that anymore? There are Neevan Marcus, one of the two.
[01:50.080 --> 01:52.720]  He isn't there anymore? I don't know. I don't know.
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.640]  Jackson, does he still work there? I don't know. What's the matter, Iggy?
[01:56.640 --> 01:59.520]  He grabbed the wrong mic. He's grabbing mics and he's throwing a gun.
[01:59.520 --> 02:02.240]  He's throwing a world over there. What's happening?
[02:02.240 --> 02:04.880]  This is the audio version of setting one's self on fire.
[02:04.880 --> 02:07.840]  This is the Rizzio's. This is the Rizzio's interview. I just took, grabbed the Maroon mic.
[02:08.720 --> 02:12.000]  Now you know how easy it is, Iggy. I gotta put the condom on.
[02:14.040 --> 02:20.040]  I think I would anticipate being able to have a little Christmas with the little one.
[02:20.040 --> 02:23.040]  The due date was Monday and the baby was born Tuesday.
[02:23.040 --> 02:27.040]  So that's pretty good on the Oscars part to pick it by a day.
[02:27.040 --> 02:29.040]  That's really good.
[02:29.040 --> 02:31.040]  Months out.
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.040]  How do you do Christmas with a three-day-old or a five-day-old?
[02:35.040 --> 02:37.040]  Well, I won't have to.
[02:37.040 --> 02:38.040]  Isn't that nice?
[02:38.040 --> 02:42.040]  I've done that three times and won't have to do it again.
[02:12.080 --> 02:14.240]  What do you mean Rizz interview? I grabbed the wrong mic.
[02:14.240 --> 02:20.720]  It's a reference to when Iggy in between the Seamaster and Gangster Pete was handling my podcast
[02:21.520 --> 02:31.200]  and did not record or did not have a mic on. I now get blamed for talking into the wrong mic either way.
[02:31.200 --> 02:34.320]  And I just edited an episode, thank the great Buck Swope,
[02:34.960 --> 02:41.760]  about Jay Jr. referencing when he was in one day that interview because we played some terrible
[01:54.560 --> 01:59.280]  That's J-E-F-F-L-O-T-T-M-A-N-N.com.
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.040]  He is selling homes and he is also somebody who can let you know
[02:05.840 --> 02:08.400]  if there's a little rumbling about a home going on the market
[02:08.400 --> 02:11.120]  in a market in which it is super competitive
[02:11.920 --> 02:15.280]  because supply is low but demand is high.
[02:15.280 --> 02:17.760]  So you need somebody who knows the market, has connections.
[02:17.760 --> 02:24.320]  Well, with 22 years of experience in St. Louis and half a billion dollars in sales,
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.040]  You think about last Christmas, I just thought about this last night.
[02:45.040 --> 02:48.040]  Christmas is going to be close to 60.
[02:48.040 --> 02:51.040]  Remember last Christmas, the wind chill was like 32 below.
[02:51.040 --> 02:54.040]  That was the one time last year where it was brutally cold.
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.040]  I get a 92-degree difference in temperature from a year ago.
[02:58.040 --> 03:04.040]  I read where a barring major collapse, 2023, is going to go down as the warmest year on record.
[03:04.040 --> 03:07.040]  In locally or locally?
[03:07.040 --> 03:08.040]  I was thinking about my...
[03:08.040 --> 03:11.040]  I think globally. It wasn't just St. Louis. I think it's globally.
[02:41.760 --> 02:46.400]  audio clip that I'm sure just gives in the flow. I'm sure has a couple drops to it.
[02:46.400 --> 02:50.000]  Well, I don't know who would do that. I mean, Mic 4 is here, Mic 5 is there.
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.280]  Mic 5 was drugged over here. Something happens overnight and in the weekends in this little closet.
[02:53.280 --> 02:54.080]  My little closet. My little closet.
[02:54.080 --> 02:56.240]  Way over there. I mean, who would do that?
[02:56.240 --> 02:59.440]  I get here early and it just always seems like something's a little off.
[03:00.160 --> 03:02.800]  Wonder what goes on? I don't know. I don't know.
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.560]  Did somebody come in and podcast at night? Well, probably an easy place to like hide
[03:06.560 --> 03:08.400]  like in the evenings if you just want to chill and hang out.
[02:24.560 --> 02:27.600]  in real estate in St. Louis, Jeff Lottman is that person.
[02:27.600 --> 02:28.640]  He's with Compass Realty.
[02:28.640 --> 02:30.880]  He went to Compass Realty to give you the luxury experience.
[02:30.880 --> 02:32.480]  But luxury is not about price points,
[02:32.480 --> 02:36.880]  but the quality of a luxury experience and the service you receive.
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.400]  He's online at J-E-F-F-L-O-T-T-M-A-N-N.com.
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.360]  Yeah, J-E-F-F-L-O-T-T-M-A-N-N.com.
[02:47.360 --> 02:49.040]  Jeff Lottman, Compass Realty.
[02:49.040 --> 02:51.120]  And the EDF Group sponsor of our text inbox.
[02:51.120 --> 02:52.560]  Do you have a fire extinguisher where we work?
[02:52.560 --> 02:53.600]  The answer is yes, you certainly do.
[03:11.040 --> 03:17.040]  Thinking about my childhood Christmases, when I got a back ball hoop and it was outside or like a bike,
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.040]  it was always snowy and always freezing cold, kind of perfect.
[03:21.040 --> 03:25.040]  I'm not a big greenhouse gases, that sort of thing.
[03:25.040 --> 03:28.040]  But it is weird to have it be 60 and not snowy.
[03:28.040 --> 03:33.040]  I think I heard last night on the news. Well, I'm pretty sure. I know I heard it.
[03:33.040 --> 03:38.040]  He said that this is the latest that we've ever gone without having to snow.
[03:08.480 --> 03:11.840]  This office space is huge. There's so many different places to hide.
[03:11.840 --> 03:14.720]  Even if you wanted to hide, you wouldn't come in and rearrange the microphones.
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.040]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like an odd thing to do. Carl Pelker is in there and he says,
[03:21.040 --> 03:24.720]  Hi, Dougie, we love you. We love you long time. You know Carl Pelker?
[03:25.360 --> 03:28.080]  Well, the name sounds familiar. Wasn't he a soccer player?
[03:28.640 --> 03:35.040]  Well, he loves you long time. The callous coitus says this is the last day we get to see Tim
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.800]  So please email the EDF Group at fire at the EDF Group.com.
[02:56.800 --> 02:59.200]  So a technician can come out and explain to your team
[02:59.200 --> 03:01.120]  how the EDF Group can save your company money.
[03:01.120 --> 03:04.640]  Again, that email address is fire at the EDF Group.com.
[03:04.640 --> 03:09.040]  The EDF Group is high and will prevent your facility from having high fires.
[03:09.040 --> 03:10.320]  Experience the EDF Group difference.
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.640]  Learn more at the EDF Group.com.
[03:14.640 --> 03:16.000]  And you should probably think about it.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.640]  Now Jackson sent me a text and it says the following, Doug.
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.200]  Kara the lesbian on hold don't know what's going on.
[03:38.040 --> 03:41.040]  We're going to have the latest snow in St. Louis anyway.
[03:41.040 --> 03:44.040]  We haven't had even a hint of snow.
[03:44.040 --> 03:50.040]  But if you get all worked up about global warming, all you've got to do again is remember what happened last year.
[03:50.040 --> 03:52.040]  It was horribly cold.
[03:52.040 --> 03:55.040]  I remember when I first started in radio, the man the woman was going on.
[03:55.040 --> 03:57.040]  And I remember when I got fired.
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.040]  They made me... I came in and did all the pre-production work for the shows and then they fired me.
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.040]  Smart play on their part.
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.040]  But I remember...
[04:04.040 --> 04:06.040]  They were very savvy.
[03:35.600 --> 03:40.400]  before break boys revel in those baby blues as long as you can, baby. Doug,
[03:40.400 --> 03:47.200]  that's from the callous coitus and a pastry chef named Mesphen is also in there. Car washes in
[03:47.200 --> 03:52.640]  winter or a hot bed for digital play. I don't know what any of this means, but it's all wonderful.
[03:52.640 --> 03:55.520]  Would you like to train to become a pastry chef yourself?
[03:56.320 --> 03:59.600]  There's no way I would have taken a lot of training a year or two.
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.040]  If Mesphen would teach me. Yeah, he was the best. See, there you go.
[03:23.600 --> 03:25.040]  But she's on hold.
[03:25.040 --> 03:25.540]  Okay.
[03:27.040 --> 03:29.520]  She just wanted to call and say hi.
[03:29.520 --> 03:30.720]  That's what's going on.
[03:30.720 --> 03:32.640]  What kind, what's she promoting?
[03:32.640 --> 03:33.680]  I have no clue.
[03:33.680 --> 03:34.560]  Gotta be a workout.
[03:34.560 --> 03:35.840]  She said she wanted to say hi.
[03:35.840 --> 03:37.840]  So I was supposed to say no don't follow.
[03:37.840 --> 03:38.800]  And how do we know her from?
[03:38.800 --> 03:39.600]  Longtime listener?
[03:40.480 --> 03:41.840]  Probably got an Etsy channel.
[03:42.640 --> 03:43.600]  How do we know her from?
[03:44.240 --> 03:45.440]  She used to be on the show.
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.200]  She did a show with Jay I think and started with Jeff Burton and Tom.
[03:49.200 --> 03:50.240]  Was part of that show.
[04:06.040 --> 04:08.040]  That one time I actually gave them credit.
[04:08.040 --> 04:14.040]  But I remember just having a couple of the worst winners there in like 14, 15.
[04:14.040 --> 04:17.040]  I just remember it being almost a foot of snow.
[04:17.040 --> 04:20.040]  Wasn't able to really get to the station.
[04:20.040 --> 04:23.040]  You don't see that as much anymore.
[04:23.040 --> 04:25.040]  Maybe in January or February we'll get a little bit.
[04:25.040 --> 04:27.040]  We could still get it.
[04:27.040 --> 04:29.040]  I think it's just fabulous.
[04:29.040 --> 04:30.040]  I know you do.
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.040]  I think it's great.
[04:31.040 --> 04:34.040]  What's not to like about 50 or 60 degrees?
[04:03.120 --> 04:05.520]  What did he make? Oh, everything. Tarts.
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.040]  Pastry chef, fries, Bombay. His name was Mesphen.
[04:11.040 --> 04:14.160]  Scones? How was his scone game?
[04:15.200 --> 04:19.440]  Not a lot of scones in Bermuda for some reason. You think so with the English background.
[04:19.440 --> 04:22.720]  Could he fashion a stolen? Oh, he did a great stolen.
[04:23.760 --> 04:28.640]  Good morning. This hijacking gets a zero out of 10. Zero. No points by your heard.
[04:28.640 --> 04:30.240]  Come on. Hetching. They didn't do anything.
[03:51.200 --> 03:53.840]  She was going to be at the year end awards.
[03:54.720 --> 03:55.760]  But didn't make it right?
[03:55.760 --> 03:57.040]  Yeah she wasn't there I don't think.
[03:57.040 --> 03:59.280]  Unless there's a lot of people there I didn't see so.
[04:01.280 --> 04:02.160]  Is she on hold?
[04:02.800 --> 04:03.760]  Well I don't know.
[04:03.760 --> 04:04.960]  We can see who this is.
[04:04.960 --> 04:06.640]  What the gentleman decided to call.
[04:07.360 --> 04:07.840]  Hello.
[04:07.840 --> 04:08.320]  Kara.
[04:08.320 --> 04:08.800]  Hi.
[04:08.800 --> 04:09.280]  Good morning.
[04:09.280 --> 04:09.920]  Hi.
[04:09.920 --> 04:11.120]  Doug it's Kara the lesbian.
[04:11.120 --> 04:13.680]  Oh my god it's Kara the lesbian.
[04:13.680 --> 04:14.160]  Hello Kara.
[04:15.600 --> 04:17.200]  It's even good spirits this morning.
[04:17.200 --> 04:17.920]  Hi Iggy.
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.920]  Hi everybody that I don't know.
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.040]  We've been playing golf the entire fall.
[04:37.040 --> 04:38.040]  Christmas should have snow.
[04:38.040 --> 04:40.040]  I'm not saying beforehand or afterward.
[04:40.040 --> 04:41.040]  Well, dusting would be nice.
[04:41.040 --> 04:43.040]  I think every Christmas have a little dusting.
[04:43.040 --> 04:45.040]  Two inches, three inches.
[04:45.040 --> 04:47.040]  Just to have it coated over the streets.
[04:47.040 --> 04:49.040]  You got it on the trees.
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.040]  I don't want feet.
[04:50.040 --> 04:51.040]  And I don't want it for months at a time.
[04:51.040 --> 04:52.040]  But just that one day.
[04:52.040 --> 04:53.040]  I don't want to...
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.040]  I don't want to...
[04:54.040 --> 04:55.040]  Yeah, I'd like that.
[04:55.040 --> 04:57.040]  Ew.
[04:57.040 --> 05:01.040]  Well, I guess if you take the average of what we have this year and what we had last year,
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.440]  Late as temper tantrum. And now he's talking about himself and painting, literally painting.
[04:35.440 --> 04:38.800]  Oh, panting. I'm sorry. Panting, literally panting into the mic.
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.800]  What the F. It's two minutes into the show. Doug, that's from Colts columnist Brian Hinton.
[04:42.800 --> 04:47.360]  Okay. I didn't hijack anything. Hinton's always right there.
[04:47.360 --> 04:49.520]  Somebody asked me about Mesphen. I answered the question.
[04:49.520 --> 04:51.840]  Hinton doesn't miss a beat though. I'll give him that.
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.880]  Mr. Licks hands out the cologne samples in between cleaning up the toilet. By the way,
[04:20.000 --> 04:20.480]  Hello.
[04:22.480 --> 04:24.720]  Kara the lesbian it's been such a long time.
[04:24.720 --> 04:26.240]  Hello welcome to the ward.
[04:26.240 --> 04:26.960]  Judy Tanuta.
[04:28.560 --> 04:30.960]  Were you in hot shots in Webster Grows this past Thursday?
[04:30.960 --> 04:37.200]  No and I just I called to say that you know I really wanted to go and I'm sorry I couldn't make it.
[04:37.200 --> 04:42.320]  Me and Iggy had talked a little bit back and forth about me joining you guys for the awards.
[04:42.320 --> 04:45.360]  And I wasn't going to go unless I got an award.
[04:45.360 --> 04:46.800]  So that's why I wasn't there.
[04:46.800 --> 04:49.040]  Well you got to take one of the eight's to show up to get there.
[05:01.040 --> 05:03.040]  you'd come up with about normal.
[05:03.040 --> 05:07.040]  There was plenty of snow on skanksgiving if you knew where to look.
[05:07.040 --> 05:08.040]  Know what I'm saying?
[05:08.040 --> 05:09.040]  That's from Mr. Big Cream.
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.040]  Well, I get the drift.
[05:11.040 --> 05:14.040]  But also there was snow in my hometown on Thanksgiving.
[05:14.040 --> 05:15.040]  Those are on?
[05:15.040 --> 05:16.040]  Yeah, just three hours away.
[05:16.040 --> 05:17.040]  Next little dusting.
[05:17.040 --> 05:23.040]  It takes 30 to 45 minutes around a baby to remind me why I quit after two kids.
[05:23.040 --> 05:24.040]  It's from Bearcats.
[05:24.040 --> 05:26.040]  He's the father of little Bearcats.
[05:26.040 --> 05:27.040]  It's work.
[05:27.040 --> 05:28.040]  It's work for sure.
[04:56.880 --> 05:01.520]  the crapper at Front Neck Plaza is pretty nice. Doug Guts from the Worsenwoods Wacko.
[05:01.520 --> 05:04.400]  Mr. Licks is one of those guys who should praise cologne on you.
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.480]  Yeah, for a dollar in the bathroom. And now they're advertising with us?
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.560]  They are. Great to have them on board.
[05:10.560 --> 05:13.440]  Is anybody still shop there? Every time I go by there, there's parking lots empty.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.800]  You're shopping in sacks?
[05:14.800 --> 05:18.080]  No, when I drive by there on Lindbergh, I just look in the parking lots right there.
[05:18.080 --> 05:21.200]  There's like no cars there. It's been packed this holiday season.
[05:21.200 --> 05:25.520]  Packed? I was there a week, last weekend I guess. Packed.
[05:28.040 --> 05:32.040]  There's a reason why you're supposed to have your kids when you're in your 20s and early
[05:32.040 --> 05:33.040]  30s.
[05:33.040 --> 05:35.040]  Otherwise, you wouldn't have the energy to keep up.
[05:35.040 --> 05:39.040]  You see some of these old pictures from 100 years ago where they got 15 kids.
[05:39.040 --> 05:40.040]  God almighty.
[05:40.040 --> 05:41.040]  Mom looks like she's 60 years old.
[05:41.040 --> 05:42.040]  She's probably 35.
[05:42.040 --> 05:43.040]  I am telling you.
[05:43.040 --> 05:45.040]  What is the deal with that?
[05:45.040 --> 05:47.040]  Well, they didn't have birth control for starters.
[05:47.040 --> 05:48.040]  No, no, no.
[05:48.040 --> 05:49.040]  I could be...
[05:49.040 --> 05:52.040]  Yeah, the large family thing, that's a separate conversation.
[05:52.040 --> 05:55.040]  But I'm talking about, like, you'll see pictures.
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.080]  You had plenty left over.
[04:51.520 --> 04:53.200]  You kept spoken on behalf of sex.
[04:55.040 --> 04:57.040]  It's really hard for me not to cuss.
[04:57.040 --> 05:00.400]  I'm a part of a podcast right now where there's no FCC regulations.
[05:00.400 --> 05:00.640]  Yeah.
[05:00.640 --> 05:01.280]  So it's like.
[05:02.480 --> 05:03.280]  Be careful.
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.480]  Watch your language now.
[05:04.480 --> 05:05.520]  It's very different for me not to cuss.
[05:06.080 --> 05:07.920]  What is the name of your podcast?
[05:09.200 --> 05:10.880]  Actually it is Audio Inc.
[05:10.880 --> 05:14.960]  We just did a show celebrating Tom and Jeff.
[05:14.960 --> 05:16.400]  So that was really fun.
[05:16.400 --> 05:18.640]  We talked about you a little bit Tim McKernan.
[05:25.600 --> 05:27.680]  Can you still buy fur coats there, do you think?
[05:27.680 --> 05:33.040]  I don't buy fur coats. I'm sure there are fur coats there.
[05:33.920 --> 05:35.360]  I want a fake fur coat.
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.680]  Have you seen one in St. Louis in the last 10 years? I can't think of one that I've seen.
[05:39.680 --> 05:40.880]  Where would you see one? Where would you see a fur coat?
[05:40.880 --> 05:42.000]  Saks Fifth Avenue.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.600]  Yeah, but like where would somebody wear one?
[05:43.600 --> 05:45.600]  Oh, some gala.
[05:46.880 --> 05:47.600]  Your end awards?
[05:47.600 --> 05:50.000]  Yeah, I see for sure. I could see a couple.
[05:50.800 --> 05:51.840]  It's growing on end.
[05:51.840 --> 05:55.200]  Maybe a fur. You're talking about a fur collar or the whole thing is fur.
[05:18.640 --> 05:19.200]  Oh really?
[05:20.160 --> 05:21.200]  I mean come on.
[05:21.200 --> 05:25.680]  That episode where Tom Jeff and I came into the studio with Coach.
[05:25.680 --> 05:26.640]  You remember Coach right?
[05:26.640 --> 05:27.520]  Oh sure absolutely.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.360]  Our blind sports guy.
[05:29.360 --> 05:30.000]  Yeah.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.360]  Well he's here in this building in the afternoons oftentimes.
[05:33.360 --> 05:34.160]  Yeah that's right.
[05:34.160 --> 05:34.720]  That's right.
[05:35.760 --> 05:41.360]  And Jay did a little lap around my big toe with the strawberry lube.
[05:42.320 --> 05:43.120]  Clip that off.
[05:43.120 --> 05:43.600]  No.
[05:44.480 --> 05:45.360]  Is Jay part of that show?
[05:55.040 --> 05:59.440]  And some of this stuff, I can see videos or pictures from the 1980s, and I'll be looking
[05:59.440 --> 06:03.960]  at that M.F.R. and it's like he's 45 and I'm like, I thought he was 70.
[06:03.960 --> 06:05.600]  I wonder what the hell the deal was.
[06:05.600 --> 06:07.600]  And it's even worse to farther back his goals.
[06:07.600 --> 06:08.600]  Yeah.
[06:08.600 --> 06:10.040]  I think it's probably people smoked.
[06:10.040 --> 06:11.760]  People smoked a lot more.
[06:11.760 --> 06:12.760]  They drank harder.
[06:12.760 --> 06:13.760]  I don't think...
[06:13.760 --> 06:14.760]  People probably weren't having anal, right?
[06:14.760 --> 06:15.760]  No, they had nothing to do.
[06:15.760 --> 06:17.160]  Char-cold meat, left and right.
[06:17.160 --> 06:18.160]  Rest differently.
[06:18.160 --> 06:19.160]  Haters, you know.
[06:19.160 --> 06:20.160]  Analberg gives you a glow.
[06:20.160 --> 06:22.920]  But they didn't have, like, the creams and the eyeliner.
[05:45.440 --> 05:50.560]  The memory that I keep concealed close to my heart about Jay Randolph Jr.
[05:52.080 --> 05:53.200]  forever rest in peace.
[05:53.200 --> 05:53.680]  Amen.
[05:53.680 --> 05:54.960]  With his strawberry lube.
[05:54.960 --> 06:01.680]  How did that feel when Jay was working over your big toe with that strawberry lubricant?
[06:01.680 --> 06:02.160]  No.
[06:02.160 --> 06:04.320]  You know it made.
[06:07.120 --> 06:12.880]  You know how you guys have that sponsor for your hair plugs and stuff.
[06:12.880 --> 06:13.360]  Sure.
[06:13.360 --> 06:13.920]  Hair restoration.
[05:55.200 --> 05:55.680]  Fur coat.
[05:56.480 --> 05:57.600]  How about imitation fur?
[05:57.600 --> 06:00.480]  That's what I said, a fake fur coat. I don't want to wear a real fur.
[06:01.280 --> 06:03.760]  Like a fake raccoon or...
[06:04.640 --> 06:07.520]  God, out of all the animals you could pick in the kingdom.
[06:07.520 --> 06:09.040]  I mean, I'm watching this show.
[06:10.160 --> 06:11.600]  Well, they're plentiful and they're cheap.
[06:11.600 --> 06:16.080]  I'm watching the show that 50 Cent did. It's actually fabulous. The power. Have you seen the
[06:16.080 --> 06:16.560]  power?
[06:16.560 --> 06:17.200]  No, I've heard that.
[06:17.200 --> 06:18.640]  Trilogy. There's like three of them.
[06:18.640 --> 06:19.680]  I haven't knocked it out yet.
[06:19.680 --> 06:23.680]  They're very good. But everybody's got fur coats. All the guys got fur coats on. They look good.
[06:14.720 --> 06:17.120]  It made my hair grow naturally on my chest.
[06:17.120 --> 06:17.760]  Did it really?
[06:17.760 --> 06:18.240]  Wow.
[06:18.880 --> 06:20.160]  Very erotic.
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.440]  Hope it doesn't put him on a business.
[06:22.640 --> 06:24.560]  I forgot how do we find out you were a lesbian?
[06:26.400 --> 06:30.480]  You know Jeff actually gave me that name when I started with them
[06:31.120 --> 06:35.360]  at the point and he was just like you know I don't think you need a name let's just call you
[06:35.360 --> 06:36.240]  Cara the lesbian.
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.280]  Simple as that.
[06:22.920 --> 06:25.560]  Like, he didn't have the beauty...
[06:25.560 --> 06:26.560]  Yeah, the maniacalism around.
[06:26.560 --> 06:30.080]  You didn't have necessarily that beautification was a necessity.
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.320]  Certainly with seven kids living in probably like a shack.
[06:32.320 --> 06:33.320]  Yeah.
[06:33.320 --> 06:34.320]  Last thing you're gonna...
[06:34.320 --> 06:37.640]  You ever seen video of some of the old hockey players and pictures of old hockey players?
[06:37.640 --> 06:38.640]  Harold Snips.
[06:38.640 --> 06:40.400]  No, I'm going way back before that.
[06:40.400 --> 06:43.360]  I'm going with Gordie Howe, Johnny Bauer, that era.
[06:43.360 --> 06:44.840]  It looks like a seniors division.
[06:44.840 --> 06:45.840]  Eddie Shaq.
[06:45.840 --> 06:52.840]  Speaking of which, I saw on Twitter a screenshot of Bob Thurman from the Golden State Warriors
[06:25.440 --> 06:26.640]  I had one once.
[06:26.640 --> 06:27.520]  What happened to it?
[06:28.480 --> 06:29.520]  I think it was real too.
[06:32.080 --> 06:34.160]  They had a sale on and it was a real snowy day.
[06:35.040 --> 06:39.200]  And me and my brother said, yeah, let's go shopping. The streets are going to be empty.
[06:39.760 --> 06:41.840]  They got a sale on fur coats. I want to go look at them.
[06:43.280 --> 06:47.920]  So I saw this one. It was like it came down to my waist. It was real bulky, black.
[06:49.040 --> 06:53.040]  And I said, I like this, but he says, no, that's a unisex. Anybody can wear that.
[06:39.920 --> 06:43.040]  Are you married now?
[06:43.040 --> 06:44.320]  Girl from what's going on with you?
[06:44.320 --> 06:44.800]  Yes.
[06:44.800 --> 06:48.320]  I have been married for nine months tomorrow actually.
[06:48.320 --> 06:49.040]  Wow.
[06:49.040 --> 06:49.760]  How about that?
[06:50.720 --> 06:52.160]  Yeehaw baby.
[06:52.160 --> 06:53.760]  I am living the dream.
[06:54.400 --> 06:55.600]  Double taxes.
[06:55.600 --> 06:57.040]  You know what I'm saying.
[06:57.040 --> 06:58.080]  How about that dawg?
[06:58.080 --> 06:59.200]  Do you have kids?
[06:59.200 --> 07:04.320]  I didn't read the caption but I saw a picture of you and your wife with two kids.
[07:05.200 --> 07:06.320]  Oh those are my nephews.
[07:06.320 --> 07:06.800]  Oh okay.
[07:07.600 --> 07:08.400]  No no no no no.
[06:53.760 --> 06:54.760]  in 1970, a really good player.
[06:54.760 --> 06:55.760]  Thurman, I think.
[06:55.760 --> 06:56.760]  Nate Thurman.
[06:56.760 --> 06:57.760]  Nate Thurman.
[06:57.760 --> 06:58.760]  Thank you so much.
[06:58.760 --> 06:59.760]  He looks...
[06:59.760 --> 07:00.760]  He was 25 years old.
[07:00.760 --> 07:01.760]  He looks 45.
[07:01.760 --> 07:02.760]  He's bald.
[07:02.760 --> 07:05.360]  Like, he's got, like, the hairline's in the middle of the hair.
[07:05.360 --> 07:08.960]  He's got this gray and black beard.
[07:08.960 --> 07:10.040]  He's 25.
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.240]  He looks like he's 50.
[07:11.240 --> 07:13.640]  Remember when Greg Oden came up with Ohio State?
[07:13.640 --> 07:14.640]  Oh, God.
[07:14.640 --> 07:15.640]  It was about the...
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.640]  Right about in 2000 or was it that era anywhere?
[07:17.640 --> 07:18.640]  Like, oh five.
[07:18.640 --> 07:19.640]  Yeah, oh five.
[07:19.640 --> 07:20.640]  Oh five.
[07:20.640 --> 07:21.640]  And he looked really old.
[06:53.760 --> 06:58.480]  I bought it and everybody just said, God, you were the talk of the town.
[06:58.480 --> 07:04.080]  A woman. Oh, it ended up being a woman's. I ended up leaving it when Barrett fired me.
[07:04.880 --> 07:05.520]  It was hanging.
[07:05.520 --> 07:06.720]  Viva la strown.
[07:06.720 --> 07:08.400]  It was hanging up in the back coat room.
[07:09.600 --> 07:10.320]  You left it there.
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.160]  And I forgot to get it when I went back. I was gone with my phone numbers and everything else.
[07:14.160 --> 07:15.440]  But Barrett stole your coat.
[07:15.440 --> 07:17.200]  Let me break this down for you real quick.
[07:17.840 --> 07:22.960]  I really just wanted for a coat. Dirty Chewbacca says, can I ask why he is selling his gaga
[07:08.400 --> 07:10.800]  I am way too selfish for kids honeypot.
[07:10.800 --> 07:11.360]  Mm-mm.
[07:11.360 --> 07:12.720]  Don't call him honeypot.
[07:12.720 --> 07:13.360]  Honeypot.
[07:14.080 --> 07:14.960]  I like that a lot.
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.360]  No way Jose.
[07:17.360 --> 07:21.760]  Anyway I just I know you guys have a lot to get through and congratulations on all of your
[07:21.760 --> 07:22.560]  sponsorships.
[07:22.560 --> 07:26.800]  Holy cow you guys are sponsored to the deck to the nine.
[07:26.800 --> 07:30.800]  Yeah well I appreciate it Cara but I don't want you I don't want you to be a stranger.
[07:30.800 --> 07:32.880]  So how can people listen to your program?
[07:33.760 --> 07:34.960]  Just download the program?
[07:34.960 --> 07:36.480]  A podcast I should say.
[07:21.640 --> 07:23.440]  What it was like living through World War II.
[07:23.440 --> 07:27.120]  I remember watching him get the Gatorade Player of the Year award.
[07:27.120 --> 07:29.160]  He was 17.
[07:29.160 --> 07:32.520]  He looked like a father of five and just retired.
[07:32.520 --> 07:33.880]  Like, it's impressive.
[07:33.880 --> 07:38.680]  I suppose that shouldn't be so surprising because usually the top athletes in high school
[07:38.680 --> 07:42.600]  and college are going to be people who matured earlier than the others.
[07:42.600 --> 07:46.680]  I will say I saw Greg Oden last year and he looks about the same as he did in high school.
[07:46.680 --> 07:47.320]  That's the weird thing.
[07:23.040 --> 07:27.520]  autograph and his used jackets on marketplace? Doug, what does that mean?
[07:27.520 --> 07:28.240]  I don't know.
[07:28.240 --> 07:28.560]  Yeah.
[07:28.560 --> 07:29.840]  Easiest way to sell things.
[07:29.840 --> 07:34.960]  When I moved and I didn't even know I had these two jackets, I'm never going to wear them.
[07:36.640 --> 07:39.680]  I actually had three. I had a Jayhawks letterman's jacket.
[07:39.680 --> 07:40.880]  How did you get that?
[07:40.880 --> 07:43.920]  I don't know. I really don't know where it came from. It was in my closet.
[07:43.920 --> 07:45.920]  What is a gaga? You have a Lady Gaga autograph?
[07:45.920 --> 07:46.640]  Yeah, I do.
[07:46.640 --> 07:49.520]  And it's just, it just sits in my bookshelf. I don't.
[07:49.520 --> 07:51.920]  Well, who would want to buy an autograph that you got?
[07:36.480 --> 07:42.880]  Anywhere you stream your podcast so Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio.
[07:42.880 --> 07:45.840]  We're also on YouTube if you want to watch our faces.
[07:45.840 --> 07:49.040]  It is Audio Inc. Inc. with a K-I-N-K.
[07:50.240 --> 07:52.240]  We just had Steve Ewing on the show.
[07:52.240 --> 07:54.240]  Jeff Scheele from Gravity Kills was on.
[07:55.760 --> 07:58.080]  Scott and Coach were just on on the Tom and Jeff show.
[07:59.120 --> 08:01.280]  But yeah give us a listen.
[08:01.280 --> 08:01.920]  We're pretty funny.
[08:01.920 --> 08:03.680]  Well I'm pretty funny you know whatever.
[08:03.680 --> 08:05.840]  That sounds like a funny pot.
[07:47.320 --> 07:53.480]  He aged 35 years in five years and then has not aged a bit in 20 years.
[07:53.480 --> 07:56.720]  You haven't heard much from him since he showed his wean.
[07:56.720 --> 07:59.120]  He's the director of basketball operations for Butler University.
[07:59.120 --> 08:01.120]  Did he show his weaned?
[08:01.120 --> 08:02.120]  Hmm.
[08:02.120 --> 08:03.120]  With that effect?
[08:03.120 --> 08:05.120]  I think somebody found it or...
[08:05.120 --> 08:06.120]  Found it?
[08:06.120 --> 08:07.120]  Somebody found it.
[08:07.120 --> 08:08.120]  Hard to find.
[08:08.120 --> 08:11.120]  Act him or something because there's a picture of him with this.
[08:11.120 --> 08:13.520]  Someone's got a micro picture of him?
[08:13.520 --> 08:17.280]  No, I think he sent it to somebody and somebody got ahold of it or something.
[07:52.720 --> 07:54.880]  It just says Lady Gaga. It's not signed to me.
[07:55.440 --> 07:56.960]  What is the price point for this autograph?
[07:56.960 --> 07:57.760]  I put 400 on there.
[07:57.760 --> 07:59.280]  Oh, would you like it for 400?
[07:59.280 --> 08:00.640]  Let me give that to John Volk.
[08:00.640 --> 08:04.480]  I looked on eBay and it was anywhere from 600 to 750.
[08:04.480 --> 08:05.680]  Oh, so this is a discount.
[08:05.680 --> 08:06.960]  Sorry to say 400.
[08:06.960 --> 08:10.480]  I think unless it was a historical figure, if you didn't get the autograph yourself,
[08:10.480 --> 08:11.440]  it doesn't mean anything.
[08:12.320 --> 08:13.600]  You think people don't buy autographs?
[08:14.560 --> 08:16.400]  Well, I think they do, but it's weird.
[08:16.400 --> 08:18.480]  I mean, if you're talking about Babe Bruce, well,
[08:18.480 --> 08:18.880]  I don't know.
[08:18.880 --> 08:20.640]  Here's a picture of it from Jenny Talia.
[08:05.840 --> 08:07.280]  Funny pot dog I like that.
[08:07.280 --> 08:09.040]  Yeah bring me on sometimes I can cuss.
[08:10.720 --> 08:15.760]  But if you guys ever need a lesbian voice to brighten up your mornings I'm there.
[08:15.760 --> 08:16.320]  Give me a call.
[08:16.320 --> 08:19.360]  Yeah that's right up my alley I'll be honest with you.
[08:19.360 --> 08:20.000]  It really is.
[08:20.800 --> 08:22.560]  Hey just give me a call I'm free in the morning.
[08:22.560 --> 08:23.040]  There's you.
[08:23.040 --> 08:24.880]  So I'll be waiting right now.
[08:24.880 --> 08:25.360]  It's available in the morning.
[08:25.360 --> 08:25.840]  Yeah.
[08:25.840 --> 08:26.320]  There you go.
[08:26.320 --> 08:27.840]  I'll call you and stop you up.
[08:27.840 --> 08:29.920]  All right Cara it's great to hear from you.
[08:29.920 --> 08:30.640]  Happy holidays.
[08:30.640 --> 08:32.480]  Hey great to hear your voices.
[08:33.120 --> 08:34.240]  Can't wait to see you guys.
[08:17.280 --> 08:19.920]  That's why that guy texted Greg Oden's stovepipe.
[08:19.920 --> 08:20.920]  I remember when the...
[08:20.920 --> 08:21.920]  It was pretty big.
[08:21.920 --> 08:26.440]  The Japanese paparazzi was offering a million dollars for a naked picture of Ichiro.
[08:26.440 --> 08:27.440]  Remember that when he was his...
[08:27.440 --> 08:28.440]  Oh, I hate Ichiro.
[08:28.440 --> 08:29.440]  It's fine.
[08:29.440 --> 08:30.440]  Is it worth it being a reporter?
[08:30.440 --> 08:33.200]  You know, you're going to make a million?
[08:33.200 --> 08:34.200]  Just go snap one?
[08:34.200 --> 08:35.200]  Probably.
[08:35.200 --> 08:36.200]  Probably worth getting fired.
[08:36.200 --> 08:37.200]  I'd do way more than that.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.200]  He's a shame to you.
[08:38.200 --> 08:40.720]  I bet he never got naked in front of people.
[08:40.720 --> 08:41.880]  Probably not just for that reason.
[08:41.880 --> 08:43.080]  No, just probably.
[08:43.080 --> 08:44.480]  He just never did.
[08:34.880 --> 08:35.840]  We'll talk soon.
[08:35.840 --> 08:37.440]  Thanks for putting me through.
[08:37.440 --> 08:38.960]  Thanks Doug that's Cara the lesbian.
[08:38.960 --> 08:39.920]  All right lesbian y'all.
[08:40.720 --> 08:41.440]  That's time.
[08:42.160 --> 08:46.800]  The last time we saw her Jay was suckling upon her toe with a strawberry lubricant.
[08:46.800 --> 08:51.040]  Well he worked with some great ones and I'm sure if yous be right near the top of the list.
[08:52.640 --> 08:53.840]  Strawberry lubricant.
[08:54.720 --> 08:55.920]  Jackson what did you just send me?
[08:56.800 --> 08:57.840]  Oh just a little image.
[08:57.840 --> 09:00.080]  Oh okay I didn't know if I didn't know if somebody else I could.
[09:00.080 --> 09:01.840]  No no no no no no all good.
[08:45.480 --> 08:47.480]  Especially if there's a bounty on your ween.
[08:47.480 --> 08:48.480]  Clip that off.
[08:48.480 --> 08:54.200]  I just split it 50-50 with the reporter, get a nice shot, make sure I'm queen-shaven,
[08:54.200 --> 08:56.200]  make sure the girth and the length is...
[08:56.200 --> 08:57.200]  You can claim innocence.
[08:57.200 --> 08:58.200]  What was he doing?
[08:58.200 --> 08:59.200]  I don't know.
[08:59.200 --> 09:00.200]  I was sleeping.
[09:00.200 --> 09:04.760]  Doug, I deep teased this.
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.120]  Speaking of baseball, A.J.
[09:06.120 --> 09:09.080]  Przyński on Foul Territory is the name of the podcast.
[09:09.080 --> 09:12.640]  I think they do that every day, Monday through Friday.
[08:20.640 --> 08:21.280]  New ones to that.
[08:21.280 --> 08:21.920]  She's interested.
[08:21.920 --> 08:22.960]  Well, if you don't want to, if you don't,
[08:22.960 --> 08:24.880]  if you want a Lady Gaga autograph and you hear it,
[08:24.880 --> 08:26.720]  there's no way you're ever going to be able to get it.
[08:26.720 --> 08:30.080]  Lady Gaga signed Terry Richardson Monster Ball Book.
[08:30.960 --> 08:33.360]  And there's a picture of Iggy with Lady Gaga.
[08:33.360 --> 08:34.640]  Just to show that that's why I'm not signed.
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.280]  Right, exactly.
[08:35.280 --> 08:36.560]  And it's $400.
[08:36.560 --> 08:38.240]  She wearing the meat dress in that picture?
[08:38.240 --> 08:39.760]  No, it's a robe.
[08:39.760 --> 08:41.760]  You know those Planet Hollywood jackets?
[08:41.760 --> 08:43.600]  I saw a listener pull up there.
[08:43.600 --> 08:45.200]  Some of those are pretty pricey.
[08:45.200 --> 08:45.680]  Yeah, they are.
[08:45.680 --> 08:46.480]  They're collector items.
[08:46.480 --> 08:48.560]  I got that when I went to the Planet Hollywood grand opening.
[08:48.560 --> 08:50.320]  How much can I get that Planet Hollywood jacket for?
[09:02.480 --> 09:03.360]  God bless.
[09:03.360 --> 09:06.640]  Me and Tim will synchronize our finishes while you peg.
[09:06.640 --> 09:10.320]  That's from the recovering alcoholic from Belleville, Webster Gross.
[09:11.440 --> 09:12.240]  Who's she gonna peg?
[09:13.280 --> 09:13.760]  Doug?
[09:13.760 --> 09:14.560]  Your wife again?
[09:15.520 --> 09:17.760]  Poor girl not Cara the lesbian is involved with your wife.
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.160]  Oh well she seemed like a good sport.
[09:22.160 --> 09:23.200]  Happy go lucky.
[09:23.200 --> 09:24.320]  Called Iggy honeypot.
[09:24.320 --> 09:25.520]  I didn't like that portion.
[09:27.280 --> 09:28.240]  She's a sweetheart.
[09:28.240 --> 09:28.720]  She's fun.
[09:29.600 --> 09:31.680]  Hey Cara bring me on your show.
[09:12.640 --> 09:15.000]  I have this to say regarding the Cardinals' off-seas.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.360]  The Cardinals made their moves already.
[09:18.360 --> 09:19.360]  Marks has Cardinals.
[09:19.360 --> 09:23.560]  So you're just sipping back on some eggnog as the GM?
[09:23.560 --> 09:28.040]  They got Lynn, they got Sonny Gray, they got Kyle Gibson.
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.040]  What else are they going to do?
[09:29.040 --> 09:31.520]  They got a first baseman, they got a second baseman, they got a shortstop, they got a third
[09:31.520 --> 09:32.720]  baseman, they got a catcher.
[09:32.720 --> 09:33.720]  They're outfield stacked.
[09:33.720 --> 09:34.720]  They traded Tyler O'Neill.
[09:34.720 --> 09:39.400]  I mean, if I'm John Moselak, I'm sitting back there going, man, you know, unless something
[08:50.320 --> 08:52.320]  Well, it's a three pack for $150, right?
[08:52.320 --> 08:55.360]  No, I just put $150 for if you want to separate them.
[08:55.360 --> 08:56.320]  I gave one to Rafe.
[08:56.320 --> 08:57.360]  Rafe wanted to know.
[08:57.360 --> 09:01.440]  I guess Rafe's son, because my girlfriend is a huge Kansas Jayhawk fan.
[09:01.440 --> 09:01.920]  How much?
[09:01.920 --> 09:03.200]  I'll just give it to you.
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.160]  So I just gave it to him.
[09:05.120 --> 09:06.960]  See how the two are available.
[09:06.960 --> 09:08.480]  KG in O-Town is interested in it.
[09:08.480 --> 09:11.600]  He says he'll give you $20 in a Wishbone Ash cassette tape
[09:11.600 --> 09:13.840]  for the Lady Gaga autograph.
[09:13.840 --> 09:15.280]  A little cash, a little trade.
[09:15.840 --> 09:16.720]  So if anybody wants it.
[09:16.720 --> 09:18.080]  He just said he wanted it.
[09:18.080 --> 09:19.600]  Oh, for $400.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.720]  That comment was 100% ignored.
[09:34.720 --> 09:35.840]  She didn't even address it.
[09:35.840 --> 09:36.480]  It was perfect.
[09:36.480 --> 09:37.600]  That's from beer cats.
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.880]  Doug he's the mouagro to kill.
[09:38.880 --> 09:42.160]  Well obviously she didn't hear it because she's the one who texted me to call in.
[09:42.160 --> 09:43.680]  So I'm thinking she's not gonna ignore me.
[09:43.680 --> 09:46.960]  Yeah you'd be scheduled already if she's heard of it.
[09:46.960 --> 09:48.400]  Hey buddy more ketchup please.
[09:49.920 --> 09:50.640]  Okay sir.
[09:53.280 --> 09:54.080]  Ned dining.
[09:55.440 --> 09:56.480]  Ned dining.
[09:56.480 --> 09:57.600]  That's a job shaming.
[09:59.280 --> 09:59.760]  Yeah it is.
[09:39.400 --> 09:43.560]  crazy happens in the reliever market, I'm like, oh, man, I don't know that we're going
[09:43.560 --> 09:47.840]  to have to make any more moves because the N.L. Central isn't making any moves.
[09:47.840 --> 09:50.400]  The Brewers probably got worse this off-season.
[09:50.400 --> 09:51.800]  Losing wardrobe.
[09:51.800 --> 09:54.800]  The Cubs haven't done shit, right?
[09:54.800 --> 09:57.480]  I mean, the Pirates, okay, they signed some dudes.
[09:57.480 --> 10:02.240]  But you're like, if I'm John Moselak, I'm like, if we can just get Aronado, Goldschmidt,
[10:02.240 --> 10:07.040]  and the rest of these dudes to play up to their potential, we're good.
[10:07.040 --> 10:08.040]  There it is.
[10:02.400 --> 10:03.200]  Unbelievable.
[10:03.200 --> 10:04.800]  Man we sailed this one right.
[10:04.800 --> 10:06.400]  We have a perfect landing on this one.
[10:06.400 --> 10:07.920]  We ended it perfectly.
[10:07.920 --> 10:08.960]  That's the way it ends.
[10:09.600 --> 10:10.720]  Tim's 2023.
[10:10.720 --> 10:11.440]  Absolutely.
[10:12.400 --> 10:14.720]  We got 13, 14 days now then right?
[10:14.720 --> 10:16.480]  When do we come back that Monday?
[10:16.480 --> 10:21.280]  Tuesday the second will be fresh off of Alabama and Michigan and Texas and Washington.
[10:21.280 --> 10:22.720]  My dad birthday too the second.
[10:22.720 --> 10:23.200]  Yeah.
[10:24.640 --> 10:29.280]  See I gotta automate all those days too so the skeleton could be ripe with some new content.
[09:20.880 --> 09:23.200]  A lot of people would love a Lady Gaga autograph.
[09:23.200 --> 09:24.880]  They're never going to get one unless they buy it.
[09:24.880 --> 09:25.760]  They're never going to meet her.
[09:26.800 --> 09:29.520]  So unless you think you're going to meet Lady Gaga,
[09:29.520 --> 09:30.720]  you're never going to have her autograph.
[09:30.720 --> 09:32.000]  Oh, look at that.
[09:32.880 --> 09:33.440]  Look at this.
[09:33.440 --> 09:34.080]  Look at that.
[09:34.080 --> 09:34.640]  Yeah, look at that.
[09:34.640 --> 09:36.640]  One kind of pepper, at least one.
[09:36.640 --> 09:41.280]  I have one thing signed that is on my wall that I kept is the Tony Bennett Lady Gaga
[09:41.280 --> 09:45.200]  cheek to cheek CD that Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga signed.
[09:45.200 --> 09:46.000]  That's all I need.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.280]  So it's just so much more meaningful if you got the autograph yourself to say,
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.040]  What do you feel about that, Sam?
[10:09.040 --> 10:10.040]  What, almost exactly?
[10:10.040 --> 10:13.800]  I think it's exactly what John Moselak is probably thinking.
[10:13.800 --> 10:14.800]  Am I correct on that?
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.640]  I think that there's real merit to it.
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.080]  And I think in part because at the moment, the Cubs haven't done anything.
[10:20.080 --> 10:23.680]  And then you look around the Central and you're just going, this is not the American League
[10:23.680 --> 10:25.880]  East.
[10:25.880 --> 10:31.040]  We can just kind of win the eight games and...
[10:31.040 --> 10:35.080]  Because I thought with the console thing, I thought Otani was in play for the Cubs.
[10:35.080 --> 10:37.580]  It just felt like an all-in situation.
[10:29.520 --> 10:32.560]  Can't you know town will be in tomorrow?
[10:33.520 --> 10:35.920]  But maybe if he can't come in Cara the lesbian could come in.
[10:35.920 --> 10:37.120]  Well sure she'd be a fine addition.
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.560]  We're adding to our depth truck Doug.
[10:39.920 --> 10:41.040]  Well we like to do that.
[10:41.040 --> 10:42.800]  Said she has nothing to do in the morning so.
[10:42.800 --> 10:44.160]  We're about 98.
[10:44.160 --> 10:44.960]  98?
[10:44.960 --> 10:45.760]  You'd be good too.
[10:47.120 --> 10:47.680]  We got a deep finish.
[10:47.680 --> 10:48.960]  We didn't hit him in like February.
[10:48.960 --> 10:49.440]  Yeah.
[10:49.920 --> 10:52.240]  When things are going wrong with the Cardinals.
[10:52.240 --> 10:53.040]  Because he'll push it.
[10:53.040 --> 10:55.840]  Two injuries right into the game spring training.
[10:55.840 --> 10:57.040]  Well he's at the precedent.
[09:49.360 --> 09:50.240]  see, I did meet her.
[09:50.960 --> 09:51.840]  I know I met her.
[09:51.840 --> 09:52.640]  It's just sitting.
[09:52.640 --> 09:55.600]  It's just not something I display just sitting in my bookshelf.
[09:55.600 --> 09:57.280]  So if I can make some money off it fine.
[09:57.280 --> 10:00.320]  And somebody can make somebody happy that they got a Lady Gaga autograph.
[10:00.320 --> 10:02.320]  So be it if it doesn't sell, it doesn't sell.
[10:02.320 --> 10:02.800]  Okay.
[10:04.240 --> 10:04.720]  Gosh.
[10:06.560 --> 10:07.360]  It's no big deal.
[10:08.400 --> 10:08.640]  No.
[10:09.280 --> 10:10.400]  Have you had any nibbles?
[10:11.040 --> 10:14.800]  He said they had like 200 views clicked on it, but I guess nobody wants to buy it.
[10:14.800 --> 10:15.280]  Good luck.
[10:15.280 --> 10:15.600]  Good.
[10:16.880 --> 10:17.280]  It's fine.
[10:17.280 --> 10:18.560]  Just sit in my bookshelf again.
[10:37.600 --> 10:41.260]  If the Cubs don't do anything, I would be surprised because of exactly what you said,
[10:41.260 --> 10:42.260]  the console thing.
[10:42.260 --> 10:43.700]  I think the Reds are a real threat.
[10:43.700 --> 10:45.220]  They've got a lot of good, no players.
[10:45.220 --> 10:46.220]  I'm with you on that.
[10:46.220 --> 10:47.220]  I think that's the actual team.
[10:47.220 --> 10:48.220]  You have to win.
[10:48.220 --> 10:49.220]  Peashing?
[10:49.220 --> 10:51.660]  They got bad peashing?
[10:51.660 --> 10:52.660]  We got bad peashing.
[10:52.660 --> 10:53.660]  I guess so, yeah.
[10:53.660 --> 10:57.780]  Unfortunately, that's been Moselak's modus operandi for a while now.
[10:57.780 --> 10:59.980]  Yeah, we got enough to win the Central.
[10:59.980 --> 11:01.900]  But you don't have enough to go far in the playoffs.
[11:01.900 --> 11:03.660]  You keep doing the same thing every year.
[11:03.660 --> 11:04.660]  Million percent with Iggy.
[10:57.120 --> 11:01.200]  Just call in once be mad and you can win call over the month.
[11:01.200 --> 11:02.880]  If it's a spectacular call.
[11:02.880 --> 11:09.920]  Yeah I think we're not ignoring how great of that one call really was.
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.560]  Or be a girl and call in every once in a while or text in every once in a while you can be listed
[11:14.560 --> 11:14.960]  in the month.
[11:14.960 --> 11:16.800]  Cara get away next year.
[11:16.800 --> 11:18.080]  She's gonna win December.
[11:18.640 --> 11:24.320]  What was this bit about Iggy asking this gal to sit in on the dais for the end of the year awards?
[11:24.320 --> 11:26.240]  Was anyone else in on that decision?
[10:19.280 --> 10:20.400]  Or just give it away to somebody.
[10:20.400 --> 10:20.720]  I don't know.
[10:20.720 --> 10:27.600]  Well, I mean, from a leverage standpoint, you say this is worth $400 and then just go to zero.
[10:28.800 --> 10:32.560]  I just don't know if I would counsel you on shops would love you, Iggy.
[10:34.560 --> 10:35.440]  She's a big star.
[10:35.440 --> 10:38.000]  Why don't you just put it in the frame somewhere and keep it for yourself?
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.520]  I said it's a huge book.
[10:40.320 --> 10:45.920]  It's a Terry Terry Richardson is a famous photographer who is really in turns out he's a pervert.
[10:47.440 --> 10:48.400]  How do you know that?
[11:04.740 --> 11:05.740]  I get...
[11:05.740 --> 11:07.420]  Winning the NL Central is huge getting in the playoffs.
[11:07.420 --> 11:12.220]  But knowing that you have no chance against the Dodgers for sure, but you could probably
[11:12.220 --> 11:16.180]  name off the Braves, there's several other teams in the NL that you're going to have
[11:16.180 --> 11:18.020]  a tough time with.
[11:18.020 --> 11:19.540]  But that's in December.
[11:19.540 --> 11:20.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:20.540 --> 11:25.620]  If July rolls around and you're five games in front and the trade deadline's looming,
[11:25.620 --> 11:28.820]  you might be able to go get a piece or two that could make you better suited for the
[11:28.820 --> 11:29.820]  playoffs.
[11:29.820 --> 11:30.980]  I do have a question.
[11:30.980 --> 11:33.380]  Do we know what the definition of stacked is?
[11:26.320 --> 11:27.680]  Thanks that's from Googter.
[11:27.680 --> 11:28.320]  Yeah.
[11:28.320 --> 11:32.240]  No but I think if we were in a text chain with that question I think anyone would carry the way.
[11:32.240 --> 11:34.720]  Did you just ask her to be up there with the crowd?
[11:34.720 --> 11:36.320]  It wasn't my decision.
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.120]  She just texted me and said can I come out tonight and plug myself?
[11:43.040 --> 11:46.560]  Wait don't tell me that's not how she actually said it right?
[11:48.000 --> 11:48.800]  The content.
[11:48.800 --> 11:50.400]  I would love to see that text.
[11:50.400 --> 11:51.440]  And so what did you say?
[11:52.720 --> 11:55.280]  I said if you missed a boat on golden opportunities for the Spartans.
[10:49.120 --> 10:50.320]  Read some articles on them.
[10:50.320 --> 10:54.000]  All the girls that have worked with him have came out during the me to movement and said he's a creep.
[10:55.280 --> 10:56.640]  This one's $400.
[10:58.160 --> 11:00.640]  His book, the book, but it's signed by her.
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.200]  It's a book that he was given access to her for an entire year of the monster ball tour.
[11:05.200 --> 11:07.520]  And lady guy said, just take whatever pictures you want.
[11:07.520 --> 11:09.280]  Nothing's off off base.
[11:09.280 --> 11:12.880]  So he followed her on this tour for a year and took pictures and put a book together.
[11:12.880 --> 11:13.760]  It's a fascinating book.
[11:13.760 --> 11:15.600]  Great picture pervert book with a lady.
[11:15.600 --> 11:16.800]  But it's signed by her.
[11:33.780 --> 11:36.820]  Because you do not agree with the definition of stacked for the outfield.
[11:36.820 --> 11:38.380]  The outfield is stacked.
[11:38.380 --> 11:41.780]  It's been a revolving door for four, five, six years.
[11:41.780 --> 11:42.780]  You can go longer than that, sir.
[11:42.780 --> 11:43.780]  Free Dexter Fowler even.
[11:43.780 --> 11:44.780]  Go back before Fowler.
[11:44.780 --> 11:45.780]  Yeah, so...
[11:45.780 --> 11:47.780]  Fampiscotti Grichik, that was the answer.
[11:47.780 --> 11:48.780]  I mean, you have...
[11:48.780 --> 11:52.980]  If they went with Nootbar, Edmond, and Walker in the outfield, would you be happy with that?
[11:52.980 --> 11:55.900]  I think that's the best one.
[11:55.900 --> 11:56.900]  And it's a good outfield.
[11:56.900 --> 12:02.660]  But it's not stacked because Nootbar hasn't had a full 162 game living up to a potential
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.880]  And if I remember correctly I think I asked Tim I said what do we got going on tonight?
[11:58.880 --> 11:59.360]  Cara wants to come in.
[11:59.360 --> 12:01.040]  You want to have a girl plugged in the studio?
[12:01.040 --> 12:02.320]  I'm sure Tim will freak out.
[12:02.320 --> 12:04.240]  I would be all for it as you would imagine.
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.840]  I would vote yay immediately.
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.600]  She's using our show to plug her show.
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.240]  Can I come by Webster girls location tomorrow to promote myself?
[12:14.240 --> 12:14.960]  She didn't say plug.
[12:15.920 --> 12:17.040]  How'd you respond to that?
[12:17.840 --> 12:19.200]  I said that's that's not up to me.
[12:20.320 --> 12:21.840]  I just thought it would be good to see you.
[12:23.360 --> 12:24.880]  It's cool you can promote whatever you like.
[11:17.440 --> 11:19.360]  Do you think that hurts the value of the product?
[11:20.960 --> 11:24.800]  All the views, they probably googled the guy and were like, oh, I can't support that.
[11:25.360 --> 11:25.920]  Probably so.
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.760]  I would think it would hurt them if it was well known that he had done something.
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.280]  Doug, you know, Chairman Steven Wildwood, one of the Milagro to kill a listener of the year.
[11:33.280 --> 11:36.480]  Last year, then his speech was brilliant.
[11:36.480 --> 11:37.120]  Well, he wasn't there.
[11:38.480 --> 11:43.120]  He automatically gets his texts read now as the Milagro to kill a listener of the year.
[12:02.660 --> 12:03.660]  blocker.
[12:03.660 --> 12:04.660]  Sophomore slumps happen in baseball.
[12:04.660 --> 12:05.660]  You just don't...
[12:05.660 --> 12:06.660]  There's a lot of question marks.
[12:06.660 --> 12:10.340]  So, like, stacked is a stretch for me.
[12:10.340 --> 12:14.020]  But I agree with them in terms of the infield, but you need relief pitching.
[12:14.020 --> 12:17.300]  I don't really know if you can be confident in your bullpen.
[12:17.300 --> 12:21.580]  These guys that you just signed as starters are probably going to get shelled several
[12:21.580 --> 12:22.580]  times.
[12:22.580 --> 12:23.580]  Why do you hate surrounding Gallegos?
[12:23.580 --> 12:24.580]  Well, they...
[12:24.580 --> 12:29.380]  I mean, Lynn and Gibson are... and Michaelists, to an extent, are prone to getting absolutely
[12:29.380 --> 12:30.380]  rocked.
[12:30.380 --> 12:32.380]  Is that a good thing?
[11:43.120 --> 11:47.280]  And he says, let me fix the decimal point on that price point.
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.360]  Let's move it two spaces over to four dollars.
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.280]  And who the F mentioned this?
[11:53.280 --> 11:55.760]  He won't shut up for an hour now.
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.680]  That's from Chairman Steven Wildwood.
[11:57.680 --> 12:02.560]  Doug, your listener of the year presented by Milagro to kill a those texts have to get read
[12:02.560 --> 12:02.960]  every day.
[12:02.960 --> 12:04.880]  Yeah, that's a contractual contractual.
[12:04.880 --> 12:06.240]  And then you text in about it.
[12:06.240 --> 12:08.000]  So it makes no sense.
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.360]  You bitch about me talking about it.
[12:09.360 --> 12:11.200]  Then you text in about me talking about it.
[12:26.240 --> 12:28.080]  So you initiated the conversation?
[12:28.960 --> 12:29.440]  No.
[12:29.440 --> 12:31.680]  Well you must have said can you come by tomorrow night?
[12:31.680 --> 12:33.360]  Because then she said can I plug myself?
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.080]  She said she said can I come by your Webster girls thing tomorrow and I plug myself.
[12:38.080 --> 12:40.080]  That was the start of the conversation?
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.040]  First thing I saw.
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.160]  Good morning this text doesn't exist that's from the 830 record.
[12:44.160 --> 12:44.640]  I just made it up.
[12:44.640 --> 12:44.960]  I just made it up.
[12:44.960 --> 12:45.360]  I just made it up.
[12:45.360 --> 12:45.840]  I just made it up.
[12:45.840 --> 12:47.280]  I think it does.
[12:47.280 --> 12:50.560]  She just said Iggy and I were talking about coming by the Webster girls thing.
[12:50.560 --> 12:52.000]  So I guess she lied too.
[12:52.000 --> 12:52.960]  She's probably.
[12:52.960 --> 12:54.080]  She's like everybody's in on it.
[12:32.740 --> 12:37.100]  It isn't, but you need a solid bullpen to kind of eliminate those issues or having to
[12:37.100 --> 12:38.540]  keep them in for six innings.
[12:38.540 --> 12:42.660]  Guys, most brilliance is how he's lowered the Cardinal fans' expectations over the years.
[12:42.660 --> 12:44.020]  That's from the little Dutch boy.
[12:44.020 --> 12:45.020]  That's true.
[12:45.020 --> 12:47.100]  Like, the division is it.
[12:47.100 --> 12:48.900]  Like, that's kind of what the fans are looking at now.
[12:48.900 --> 12:51.060]  It used to be a little different.
[12:51.060 --> 12:56.580]  Like, post-2011, you kind of always felt like you were going to get a deep run.
[12:56.580 --> 12:59.840]  We don't know what kind of limitations he's been given by the ownership now that the Bally
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.940]  Sports thing is kind of up in the air.
[12:54.720 --> 12:58.240]  It's like Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci and Kevin Bacon all dipped in gold.
[12:58.240 --> 13:00.880]  She was the one that came in the parking lot and said I ran the right light.
[13:00.880 --> 13:02.240]  We made it all up.
[13:03.680 --> 13:05.680]  I love that she wants to plug herself.
[13:05.680 --> 13:07.440]  Well she's a promote I said plug.
[13:07.440 --> 13:07.920]  Same thing.
[13:08.880 --> 13:12.000]  All these crazy alien stories can't be true can they?
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.120]  Hey it's Steven Diener hosted the Unidentified Alien podcast.
[13:15.120 --> 13:18.400]  And whether you're new to the conversation or have been looking into it for years,
[13:18.400 --> 13:21.200]  you need to check out the fastest growing alien show out there.
[13:21.200 --> 13:23.200]  The Unidentified Alien podcast.
[12:11.440 --> 12:12.720]  Mm hmm.
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.720]  Was that Mrs. Jani Shannahan who asked about it?
[12:14.720 --> 12:16.160]  I don't know.
[12:16.160 --> 12:18.080]  But I just it's enough of it.
[12:18.080 --> 12:19.280]  If you want it, it's on Facebook.
[12:19.280 --> 12:19.760]  Go get it.
[12:20.480 --> 12:21.840]  DM me, come over and pick it up.
[12:23.200 --> 12:25.280]  If not, don't worry about it.
[12:25.280 --> 12:26.400]  Yeah, stuff worry.
[12:26.400 --> 12:27.440]  I put a lot of things on her.
[12:27.440 --> 12:28.480]  Nobody buys and I put other things.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.480]  I got rid of my playboys on Facebook marketplace.
[12:30.480 --> 12:31.440]  What did you get for that?
[12:31.440 --> 12:32.320]  Jake's Coke.
[12:32.320 --> 12:32.720]  Fifty.
[12:32.720 --> 12:34.080]  I got two hundred bucks for all of them.
[12:34.080 --> 12:34.960]  Look at that, Doug.
[12:34.960 --> 12:35.520]  Take that.
[12:35.520 --> 12:38.160]  Well, I said a hundred dollars for a hundred of them.
[12:38.160 --> 12:39.520]  And then two people offered.
[13:01.940 --> 13:03.220]  Well, development on that.
[13:03.220 --> 13:07.820]  I think I made reference to it briefly yesterday, but in case I didn't, Wall Street Journal,
[13:07.820 --> 13:08.820]  the story on...
[13:08.820 --> 13:13.060]  And this is, you know, I don't say it's the Wall Street Journal, like, hey, let's all
[13:13.060 --> 13:17.940]  talk about our portfolios, because we will be comparing balance sheets in the 9 o'clock
[13:17.940 --> 13:18.940]  hour.
[13:18.940 --> 13:25.540]  But because the Wall Street Journal isn't like guy on Twitter looking to build a career,
[13:25.540 --> 13:30.580]  they don't necessarily report something unless the deal is really close to being done.
[13:23.200 --> 13:24.480]  Or UAP for short.
[13:24.480 --> 13:28.240]  There's a crazy amount of alien encounter stories out there from all over the world.
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.240]  And the beauty of it is that I bring them all to you and let you decide what you believe.
[13:32.240 --> 13:35.920]  Download and subscribe to UAP on any of the major podcasting platforms.
[13:35.920 --> 13:38.800]  And you can also find it on UAPPodcast.com.
[13:39.840 --> 13:42.240]  Ladies and gentlemen it's time for the designer heating up.
[13:42.240 --> 13:42.720]  Thank God.
[13:42.720 --> 13:46.560]  I'm sure they're going to be just like the text too so it was a matter.
[13:48.640 --> 13:49.680]  Jackson you've read these?
[13:50.400 --> 13:50.800]  Yeah.
[13:50.800 --> 13:51.300]  Alright.
[13:30.580 --> 13:40.260]  But Amazon is on the verge of investing in diamond sports, which would then put the Bally's
[13:40.260 --> 13:43.760]  games on Amazon's platform.
[13:43.760 --> 13:49.940]  So that wouldn't be the case, most likely, for 2024, but in 2025.
[13:49.940 --> 13:54.540]  Bally's would still operate it, but Amazon would invest it to give it the cash infusion
[13:54.540 --> 13:56.700]  to keep it from going into bankruptcy.
[12:39.520 --> 12:41.760]  But then I started unboxing them for the one guy.
[12:41.760 --> 12:43.600]  This guy got like two hundred in here.
[12:43.600 --> 12:44.880]  Said that I'll sell him twice.
[12:44.880 --> 12:47.280]  So the one guy came and then the other guy said,
[12:47.280 --> 12:48.080]  I can pick him up today.
[12:48.080 --> 12:49.440]  And they both showed up at the same time.
[12:50.080 --> 12:51.120]  It's kind of awkward.
[12:51.120 --> 12:51.360]  Yeah.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.080]  So did they fight over which ones they got?
[12:54.080 --> 12:55.920]  No, I just separated them and the other guy left.
[12:55.920 --> 12:56.480]  I said here.
[12:58.640 --> 13:00.640]  Welcome to the yard sale with Ken Strode.
[13:00.640 --> 13:01.680]  That's from the veiled profit.
[13:01.680 --> 13:03.200]  Was that a show in Kamowaks?
[13:03.200 --> 13:04.000]  I think it used to be.
[13:04.000 --> 13:04.320]  Yeah.
[13:04.320 --> 13:05.680]  There was a trading post or something like that.
[13:05.680 --> 13:06.320]  Yeah, the trading post.
[13:06.320 --> 13:07.040]  Popular as hell.
[13:07.040 --> 13:08.320]  Yeah, what really was.
[13:51.300 --> 13:56.900]  I abstain for any email of the day votes for today.
[13:58.100 --> 14:00.100]  Mushy emails deserve none.
[14:00.980 --> 14:04.180]  Just truly happy for the entire Vaughn family.
[14:04.740 --> 14:05.780]  Congratulations.
[14:06.340 --> 14:07.460]  Such wonderful news.
[14:08.180 --> 14:10.900]  Three of the best days of my life when my son was born.
[14:10.900 --> 14:15.140]  After years of trying to show every day to my future stepson I loved him.
[14:15.140 --> 14:20.020]  He signed me as dad when I picked him up from grade school.
[13:56.700 --> 14:00.660]  So that is a substantial development.
[14:00.660 --> 14:02.940]  Didn't they already go into bankruptcy?
[14:02.940 --> 14:06.660]  They've had issues with paying a number of teams, and they announced yesterday they will
[14:06.660 --> 14:08.700]  pay three teams next year.
[14:08.700 --> 14:09.700]  Three of them.
[14:09.700 --> 14:10.700]  Do we know which three?
[14:10.700 --> 14:11.700]  Jackson, is it they won't pay three teams?
[14:11.700 --> 14:15.140]  They simply will not pay the Twins, Guardians, or the defending champions.
[14:15.140 --> 14:17.820]  That's the rough news to get right here around the holidays.
[14:17.820 --> 14:20.820]  Did he reach into like a bull and like pick the keys?
[14:20.820 --> 14:21.820]  The lottery.
[14:21.820 --> 14:23.380]  Like, just the kind of pinballs come down?
[14:23.380 --> 14:25.020]  Probably the ones with the worst ratings.
[14:25.020 --> 14:26.020]  Imagine...
[13:08.400 --> 13:09.360]  So on every Saturday.
[13:10.160 --> 13:12.080]  Chairman Steve's losing it in the text inbox.
[13:12.080 --> 13:12.560]  Who cares?
[13:12.560 --> 13:14.800]  Well, you might as well have your estate sale before you die.
[13:16.080 --> 13:18.400]  It's just something I'm not going to use and I could use the money.
[13:18.400 --> 13:19.360]  This is a state sale.
[13:19.360 --> 13:20.320]  This is what it sounds like.
[13:20.320 --> 13:22.400]  So my estate sale bring like 30 bucks.
[13:23.360 --> 13:25.520]  It's just something it's just something I'm not going to use.
[13:25.520 --> 13:28.800]  And if I can make some money off a fine, if I don't, well, it goes back in the bookshelf.
[13:29.840 --> 13:31.760]  I mean, there's I got other things I would never sell.
[13:31.760 --> 13:32.320]  Like what?
[13:33.440 --> 13:33.920]  I don't know.
[14:20.100 --> 14:23.220]  When my future stepdaughter put me as father on Facebook.
[14:23.780 --> 14:25.380]  Truly happy for you.
[14:25.380 --> 14:29.060]  That being said I vow to come back with a vengeance in 2024.
[14:29.620 --> 14:32.260]  There is an award for naughtiest 60 year old emailer.
[14:32.260 --> 14:33.540]  I'm going to ship it.
[14:33.540 --> 14:35.460]  Government name Kevin Miller.
[14:35.460 --> 14:37.300]  Wow that was like a sincere email.
[14:37.300 --> 14:38.020]  Very serious.
[14:38.020 --> 14:40.740]  Well you're not married so I'm going to be your stepson and stepdaughter.
[14:40.740 --> 14:42.020]  Kevin Miller.
[14:42.020 --> 14:43.300]  First of all you don't have a mom.
[14:43.940 --> 14:45.140]  So you can't be married.
[14:45.140 --> 14:45.620]  I'm not going to get that again.
[14:47.860 --> 14:48.740]  Dear Mr. Hubbard.
[14:26.020 --> 14:27.020]  The defending world champions.
[14:27.020 --> 14:30.540]  Yeah, it's like going to the grocery store and saying, I have 11 items here, but I'm
[14:30.540 --> 14:32.140]  not paying for three of them.
[14:32.140 --> 14:33.780]  And expecting just walk out the door.
[14:33.780 --> 14:38.260]  But can't they do that because they can do that because they filed bankruptcy?
[14:38.260 --> 14:39.260]  I thought.
[14:39.260 --> 14:42.860]  I mean, you can't just say we don't have the money to pay you and keep running.
[14:42.860 --> 14:44.220]  I love this strategy.
[14:44.220 --> 14:48.020]  It's like every day, Joe Schmoe's having like four credit cards, but they only pay two of
[14:48.020 --> 14:49.020]  them.
[14:49.020 --> 14:50.020]  It's like, okay, I got to justify it.
[14:50.020 --> 14:51.020]  It's crazy.
[14:51.020 --> 14:52.020]  Can't even make them in payments.
[14:52.020 --> 14:53.020]  I got to let them know.
[14:53.020 --> 14:54.780]  One of them is the defending World Series champions.
[14:49.300 --> 14:53.540]  I'm writing in response to a segment hurt on your thriving regional HD2 program.
[14:54.580 --> 14:58.500]  It's my understanding that your fine listeners were subjected to a motivational message from
[14:58.500 --> 15:03.940]  your board op slash button jockey slash donut guy where he instructed them that despite only
[15:03.940 --> 15:08.260]  working three hours a day and complaining about things being too expensive that you should not
[15:08.980 --> 15:15.860]  under any circumstance pick up another job for fear that you may end up having to work quote unquote
[15:15.860 --> 15:16.660]  full time.
[13:34.800 --> 13:38.880]  Autographed pictures and things like that concert books.
[13:38.880 --> 13:41.040]  This seems like quite a little momentum for you.
[13:41.040 --> 13:42.000]  Why don't you hang on to this?
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.400]  I did Stevie Nicks autographed poster for 35 years.
[13:44.400 --> 13:45.120]  I gave it to learn.
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.600]  Well, but that's not as valuable as somebody offered me 400 for it.
[13:50.480 --> 13:51.280]  Why don't you take it?
[13:52.160 --> 13:54.160]  It's like Orson Woods Wacko might be interested.
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.400]  If the shipping is not included in the Gaga penis picture book, no deal.
[13:58.400 --> 14:00.160]  That's from the Orson Woods Wacko.
[14:00.160 --> 14:02.160]  Well, if you go on there, it says pick up only.
[14:02.160 --> 14:03.360]  I'm not shipping it anywhere.
[15:17.620 --> 15:23.860]  Our country is at a crossroads and locally owned companies are closing up due to staff shortages
[15:23.860 --> 15:30.420]  and I must request that this segment not be replayed ever regards the United States economy
[15:30.420 --> 15:35.700]  aka mudjack mike not Mr. Big Cream fix the damn text line right.
[15:35.700 --> 15:37.140]  Oh no I got his reed what's in the prom.
[15:37.140 --> 15:37.860]  Mudjack.
[15:37.860 --> 15:44.340]  I gotta say like just because you misunderstood a certain segment doesn't mean you are correct on
[15:44.340 --> 15:45.620]  that. That was not what I said.
[14:55.580 --> 15:00.620]  It's a tough look, but I find it super funny because how hard it is to watch games and
[15:00.620 --> 15:03.820]  how much this has hurt several teams and the Cardinals.
[15:03.820 --> 15:04.820]  I mean, you're looking at it.
[15:04.820 --> 15:06.620]  I didn't think it would be a big deal, but it is.
[15:06.620 --> 15:07.820]  It is a real issue.
[15:07.820 --> 15:08.900]  It's an issue for the team.
[15:08.900 --> 15:09.900]  It's an issue for fans.
[15:09.900 --> 15:17.940]  And now if I was listening to Andrew Marchand and John Oren's podcast this morning in route
[15:17.940 --> 15:23.180]  to the station, and that was one of their focal points for the conversation, I would
[14:04.880 --> 14:06.000]  Pick up only.
[14:06.000 --> 14:06.800]  Come get it.
[14:06.800 --> 14:08.000]  I'm not going anywhere to get it.
[14:08.000 --> 14:08.720]  It's just a book.
[14:08.720 --> 14:10.560]  How hard is it to ship it so long?
[14:10.560 --> 14:12.640]  I'd have to go to the post office and all that.
[14:12.640 --> 14:13.120]  Yeah.
[14:13.120 --> 14:15.920]  Can you jack up the price by about $50?
[14:15.920 --> 14:17.520]  Yeah, build that into...
[14:17.520 --> 14:18.080]  It's a heavy book.
[14:18.080 --> 14:19.760]  He's still net 400.
[14:19.760 --> 14:20.480]  It's a heavy book.
[14:20.480 --> 14:21.520]  It's probably about four pounds.
[14:22.240 --> 14:25.680]  Chris Rabe says, how do you come up with these valuations, Ken?
[14:25.680 --> 14:27.120]  Let us peek behind the curtain.
[14:27.120 --> 14:29.120]  You spoiled pastrami slice?
[15:23.180 --> 15:27.500]  recommend listening to that podcast if you're interested in this topic.
[15:27.500 --> 15:35.980]  And one of the things they were saying is while the MLS may not be as prominent as the
[15:35.980 --> 15:41.740]  other four leagues in the United States, at this moment you don't hear a lot of MLS fans
[15:41.740 --> 15:49.340]  complaining about accessing games, whereas college basketball, if you want to include
[15:45.620 --> 15:49.060]  I said if you already have a part time job looking for a second one.
[15:49.780 --> 15:53.780]  Kara the lesbian just called in to tell me she wants to correct the record that she said
[15:53.780 --> 15:55.460]  that Iggy and the she had the text.
[15:55.460 --> 15:58.100]  Yeah I figured she did.
[15:58.100 --> 16:02.980]  Would that actually Kara said you want to come by and she said can I promote myself
[16:02.980 --> 16:06.580]  because not many people would just write out of the blue say can I come to your event
[16:06.580 --> 16:08.340]  and promote my show on your event.
[16:08.340 --> 16:10.100]  I think fit chick was a great example.
[16:10.100 --> 16:11.060]  Unless she was invited to go.
[16:11.060 --> 16:12.980]  No girl didn't come there willingly.
[14:30.080 --> 14:35.040]  Well, I went on eBay and I found three of them for $750, $725, and $650.
[14:35.040 --> 14:36.720]  So I just said, hunk, go 400.
[14:36.720 --> 14:39.280]  That's how you come up with the price you sell baseball cards for.
[14:40.480 --> 14:42.560]  You look and see what people are willing to pay for it.
[14:43.520 --> 14:45.840]  If nobody wants to pay for it, then it's not worth 400 bucks.
[14:47.360 --> 14:47.760]  Yep.
[14:47.760 --> 14:48.800]  He's not going to stop today.
[14:48.800 --> 14:50.880]  But that's from Chairman Steve in a while.
[14:50.880 --> 14:52.000]  Why don't you stop texting?
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.480]  How about if you stop texting, I'll stop talking about it.
[14:54.480 --> 14:58.480]  You think your texts are so important, but what I talk about doesn't count.
[15:49.340 --> 15:57.220]  that in there, along with baseball fans, NBA fans, NHL fans, of course not the NFL,
[15:57.220 --> 16:02.460]  different situation unless you don't want to have Amazon, you have no idea where your
[16:02.460 --> 16:06.900]  game is going to be, or you could have the pain in the ass of the app not working.
[16:06.900 --> 16:11.260]  And with Apple and MLS, you know where the games are going to be.
[16:11.260 --> 16:14.860]  Now, whether or not it is caught on, that is a different conversation.
[16:13.780 --> 16:15.460]  Is can you confirm that?
[16:17.220 --> 16:18.580]  I didn't see the first part of the text.
[16:18.580 --> 16:20.180]  I just read her text.
[16:20.180 --> 16:22.900]  So who but they easy who texted who refers.
[16:23.540 --> 16:27.300]  I think is what I think the question is who initiated the conversation.
[16:28.740 --> 16:30.580]  She's saying you initiated the conversation.
[16:30.580 --> 16:31.380]  I guess that's right.
[16:32.980 --> 16:33.940]  Well so it matters.
[16:33.940 --> 16:36.020]  Oh here we go.
[16:36.020 --> 16:37.940]  The crest it was a delayed crest.
[16:14.860 --> 16:21.580]  Not in this case, you would be having everything through Amazon Prime, and you would be having,
[16:21.580 --> 16:26.700]  I would imagine, the technology would improve substantially in part because of the cash
[16:26.700 --> 16:32.620]  infusion, but of course, because of the technological team that would be behind one of their major
[16:32.620 --> 16:33.860]  investors in Amazon.
[16:33.860 --> 16:40.020]  I would think, and I could be wrong, but so many people shop at Amazon, and they get Amazon
[16:40.020 --> 16:42.220]  Prime basically because you get free shipping.
[14:58.640 --> 15:00.560]  Listener of the year, he's allowed to have these texts wrong.
[15:00.560 --> 15:01.360]  I'm going to kill him.
[15:01.360 --> 15:03.200]  Yeah, listen to the air, she just calls it.
[15:03.200 --> 15:04.000]  Hey, Doug.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.040]  What's up?
[15:05.040 --> 15:05.600]  Hey, guys.
[15:05.600 --> 15:06.160]  You know what's up?
[15:07.280 --> 15:08.560]  Yeah, what'd you do last night, Doug?
[15:09.280 --> 15:10.400]  Blousie, what's up?
[15:10.400 --> 15:11.760]  Any good restaurants lately?
[15:11.760 --> 15:12.880]  It's just a stream of consciousness.
[15:12.880 --> 15:13.760]  That sounds like best.
[15:13.760 --> 15:14.960]  Stream of consciousness.
[15:14.960 --> 15:16.080]  Well, they're both the same.
[15:16.080 --> 15:18.400]  They both call and just talk gibberish.
[15:18.400 --> 15:18.880]  Oh.
[15:19.680 --> 15:20.320]  Hot takes.
[15:21.520 --> 15:23.920]  Doug, it's the mug in S. St. Louis, Acura.
[15:23.920 --> 15:26.880]  Mug in S. Burkhardt, Alton, Toyota, 7 o'clock hour.
[16:38.660 --> 16:43.060]  It was bubbling up at the surface and then it erupted.
[16:43.780 --> 16:46.820]  I told you that that damn text didn't exist.
[16:46.820 --> 16:50.260]  Cotton alive from the 830 rec curator dug and he's doing a touchdown dance.
[16:50.260 --> 16:51.220]  It just exists.
[16:51.220 --> 16:52.180]  I just read it to you.
[16:53.060 --> 16:54.980]  It's just a matter of who started it.
[16:54.980 --> 16:57.140]  You ask her to come be a part of the event.
[16:57.140 --> 16:57.620]  I started.
[16:58.660 --> 17:00.340]  It doesn't need to apologize for anything.
[17:00.340 --> 17:02.020]  We're just trying to get to the bottom of this.
[17:02.020 --> 17:02.900]  I figured it would come by.
[17:04.340 --> 17:06.820]  Well now you're exaggerating it to make it sound like it didn't happen.
[16:42.700 --> 16:45.340]  So they probably already have Amazon Prime.
[16:45.340 --> 16:49.460]  So that's a good place to put it because I think a majority of people in the country
[16:49.460 --> 16:51.940]  have it already just because they shop there.
[16:51.940 --> 16:54.740]  If you get Amazon Prime to shop, do you get it Amazon TV?
[16:54.740 --> 16:55.740]  I believe so.
[16:55.740 --> 16:56.740]  But Amazon Prime is...
[16:56.740 --> 16:57.900]  It would be an additional fee.
[16:57.900 --> 17:00.100]  It wouldn't just be just Prime.
[17:00.100 --> 17:01.100]  I would bet.
[17:01.100 --> 17:03.220]  I don't know that for sure, but I would bet.
[17:03.220 --> 17:05.580]  Lodo King says it's not hard to watch games, plowhawk.
[17:05.580 --> 17:08.340]  Pay $19.99 a month and then use the Bally app.
[17:08.340 --> 17:10.020]  That's from Lodo King.
[17:10.020 --> 17:11.460]  To watch what?
[15:26.880 --> 15:32.400]  My final one of 2023, and we're going to celebrate my 2023 throughout the day here
[15:33.040 --> 15:33.760]  at Hubbard Radio.
[15:33.760 --> 15:35.680]  I think Keshia's going to do it, 1065.
[15:35.680 --> 15:37.840]  The Arch is going to do it, 105.7 the point.
[15:37.840 --> 15:38.720]  Oh, hail Tim.
[15:38.720 --> 15:40.640]  The 923WAL, that's correct.
[15:40.640 --> 15:43.200]  Everything will be about my 2023.
[15:43.200 --> 15:45.440]  Mung in S. St. Louis, Acura, Alton, Toyota.
[15:45.440 --> 15:49.760]  Sponsor our 7 o'clock hour, Jamie Burkhardt, Clayton Patterson, Peter Mung in S.
[15:49.760 --> 15:52.720]  The absolute best, and I can't say enough good things about him.
[17:08.020 --> 17:08.740]  Worried now.
[17:08.740 --> 17:10.100]  You saw one of my responses.
[17:10.100 --> 17:10.820]  It's not up to me.
[17:11.460 --> 17:12.980]  So why would I ask her?
[17:12.980 --> 17:13.620]  You want to come by?
[17:13.620 --> 17:14.340]  It's not up to me.
[17:14.340 --> 17:15.140]  But you want to come by.
[17:15.780 --> 17:18.020]  Well you asked if she wanted to come by and she said yes.
[17:18.020 --> 17:20.180]  If I can promote the show can I do that?
[17:20.980 --> 17:22.500]  And then you said that's not up to me.
[17:24.180 --> 17:26.260]  I asked her to come by just like I asked her to call in today.
[17:27.380 --> 17:28.740]  I can't tell if this is satire.
[17:28.740 --> 17:29.220]  No I don't know.
[17:29.220 --> 17:30.740]  I think the listener you're going to take it to truth.
[17:31.460 --> 17:34.420]  The audience is celebrating what they feel like as a win.
[17:34.420 --> 17:35.220]  I can tell you that.
[17:35.220 --> 17:35.780]  Why?
[17:35.780 --> 17:36.740]  Turbosperish.
[17:36.740 --> 17:37.780]  I don't take much to get you.
[17:12.220 --> 17:14.380]  Blue's a Cardinals.
[17:14.380 --> 17:15.380]  I mean, I...
[17:15.380 --> 17:16.380]  Nah.
[17:16.380 --> 17:19.380]  I don't know how bad answer it.
[17:19.380 --> 17:22.180]  When the Rangers and the other teams that got screwed last year say, hey, you didn't
[17:22.180 --> 17:23.180]  pay us last year.
[17:23.180 --> 17:26.700]  How about not paying the Cardinals this year and give us some money?
[17:26.700 --> 17:30.180]  You can't keep stiffing us every year and paying these other teams.
[17:30.180 --> 17:35.620]  To the Mr. Lix's and the finance guys and the banking industry, I need to understand
[15:52.720 --> 15:56.880]  So if you, someone in your family is looking for a new or pre-owned vehicle,
[15:56.880 --> 16:00.800]  just go to St. Louis, Acura.com or Alton, Toyota.com, and now you're working with the best.
[16:00.800 --> 16:04.720]  And you got a question, you got a request, you got a secret number is what you got.
[16:04.720 --> 16:07.360]  314-252-0029.
[16:07.360 --> 16:10.640]  That's 314-252-0029.
[16:10.640 --> 16:14.480]  And that's the secret number to text or call to talk with the best.
[16:15.280 --> 16:18.000]  And that's my sponsor of our 7 o'clock hour.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.480]  Plowhawk, you're giggling to detect, tickle your fancy.
[17:35.620 --> 17:43.060]  how a business can still operate while filing for bankruptcy and also willingly informing
[17:43.060 --> 17:44.060]  teams.
[17:44.060 --> 17:45.060]  They're just flat not paying them.
[17:45.060 --> 17:48.780]  I actually need to know how that's legal.
[17:48.780 --> 17:54.140]  How is it legal that a business who has no money is in charge of billions of dollars
[17:54.140 --> 17:55.140]  in TV...
[17:55.140 --> 17:56.900]  And they're just not paying it.
[17:56.900 --> 17:57.900]  I don't get it.
[17:57.900 --> 18:02.860]  How did the major of baseball not step in and go, okay, this is a complete breach of
[17:37.780 --> 17:38.580]  Beer cats.
[17:38.580 --> 17:39.460]  What a life.
[17:39.460 --> 17:40.980]  Steven Wildwood.
[17:40.980 --> 17:42.100]  All the greats.
[17:42.100 --> 17:43.140]  A three one four.
[17:43.140 --> 17:44.260]  Another three one four.
[17:46.340 --> 17:47.380]  Doug we carry on with this.
[17:47.380 --> 17:49.380]  Just an easy email.
[17:49.380 --> 17:50.500]  Yeah we probably should.
[17:51.300 --> 17:55.460]  My heart skipped a beat this morning because I actually thought one half of the renters round
[17:55.460 --> 18:01.060]  table was going to leap across the dais in a jealous fit of rage to strangle his co-worker
[18:01.060 --> 18:05.860]  simply because Doug had the audacity to see learn on a television commercial.
[18:06.820 --> 18:12.900]  Go back and watch today's YouTube stream and we'll see the sadness in Iggy's eyes
[18:12.900 --> 18:18.740]  as he comes to grips with the fact that learn is a big TV star now and she'll probably forget
[18:18.740 --> 18:23.300]  all about him since he only gave her a single used coaster for Christmas.
[18:23.940 --> 18:25.060]  That's all that was in the bag.
[18:25.860 --> 18:27.060]  That's all that was in there.
[18:27.060 --> 18:30.580]  I think maybe it's on channel two news because I was watching the weather.
[18:31.460 --> 18:34.740]  Congratulations to John Vaughn and his precious baby It.
[16:20.480 --> 16:23.760]  I, I just, all the texts, I think.
[16:23.760 --> 16:24.800]  All the texts.
[16:26.480 --> 16:28.080]  They're very active this morning, Doug.
[16:28.080 --> 16:28.640]  Are they?
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.840]  They know this is the, the farewell show for 2023 and they want to get, get it all in.
[16:34.560 --> 16:35.920]  Well, they're excited about bidding.
[16:35.920 --> 16:37.520]  The letters of authenticity.
[16:38.160 --> 16:40.800]  The love of authenticity is a picture with me and her. How about that?
[16:40.800 --> 16:43.600]  Oh, that's from former fan page moderator, Neil Allen, Craig Paul.
[16:43.600 --> 16:45.200]  That sounds like he's interested.
[16:45.200 --> 16:45.920]  Yeah. Well.
[16:45.920 --> 16:47.600]  You do have a lot of interest in partying.
[16:47.600 --> 16:48.800]  It does seem like there's some.
[18:02.860 --> 18:08.260]  whatever contract you signed with these teams, you guys have no money, we're taking over.
[18:08.260 --> 18:13.340]  I don't understand how you can get in bed with this company and the company can still
[18:13.340 --> 18:14.900]  do this to teams.
[18:14.900 --> 18:16.180]  They have no money.
[18:16.180 --> 18:18.380]  How would the company afloat and running?
[18:18.380 --> 18:23.180]  I don't know much about bankruptcy law, but I think you can file for protection from your
[18:23.180 --> 18:24.180]  creditors.
[18:24.180 --> 18:25.180]  That's correct.
[18:25.180 --> 18:28.100]  How any person could do that too.
[18:28.100 --> 18:30.140]  And you don't have to pay it all back.
[18:30.140 --> 18:32.300]  You pay... you negotiate and pay the pension.
[18:36.180 --> 18:43.300]  Oh I'm sorry that St. Louis's hottest gilf was forced to hold his tongue for over an hour
[18:43.300 --> 18:48.740]  while the Diamonds direct photographer ranted about his sad little Facebook rummage sale
[18:49.540 --> 18:54.980]  on a completely coincidental note I'm selling my autographed copy of the Octomom porno for
[18:54.980 --> 19:01.380]  three thousand dollars serious inquiries only and you must pick it up in person from my
[16:48.800 --> 16:51.600]  But the price may vary. You don't have to ruin the go-to.
[16:51.600 --> 16:52.640]  Four bucks free.
[16:53.280 --> 16:54.400]  You should keep this.
[16:54.400 --> 16:58.160]  It's a picture of you and an autograph of the major celebrity of our time.
[16:58.160 --> 17:00.480]  I have the picture. I'm not giving the picture of me and her away.
[17:01.040 --> 17:03.680]  That's just to show that I met her. That's how I got assigned.
[17:04.560 --> 17:06.320]  You know, I don't have a letter of authenticity.
[17:06.320 --> 17:09.760]  I didn't say, oh, by the way, guy, can you get me a letter of authenticity for this too?
[17:09.760 --> 17:10.240]  Okay.
[17:11.680 --> 17:13.760]  It's like Vivian H. Jorzen studio.
[18:32.300 --> 18:35.460]  They've missed interest payments worth $50 million.
[18:35.460 --> 18:38.220]  I know it doesn't seem fair, but that's the law.
[18:38.220 --> 18:39.220]  People do it all the time.
[18:39.220 --> 18:40.220]  Businesses do it all the time.
[18:40.220 --> 18:44.300]  Yeah, broke Joe Schmoen that lose absolutely everything when they have no money.
[18:44.300 --> 18:49.820]  And he had a billion dollar company just to get to play baseball and play like being a
[18:49.820 --> 18:51.140]  big executive when I have them.
[18:51.140 --> 18:53.300]  I just do not get how it's possible.
[18:53.300 --> 18:54.300]  Why would Amazon throw...
[18:54.300 --> 18:58.100]  Why would you throw $3 billion and say, yeah, and you keep running it.
[18:58.100 --> 18:59.700]  They've done such a great job so far.
[18:59.700 --> 19:01.320]  Why would you let them run it?
[19:01.380 --> 19:07.620]  vomitorium if you purchase it today I'll even throw in a menthol scented hard rock cafe sweatshirt
[19:07.620 --> 19:12.500]  today's show is great but I'd like to make one suggestion please spend more time talking about
[19:12.500 --> 19:18.820]  Greg Oden's penis in 2024 you guys barely discussed the genitals of the number one pick in the 2007 NBA
[19:18.820 --> 19:24.100]  draft today if you want to take TMA to the next level stop forcing us to listen to a clueless
[19:24.100 --> 19:29.460]  mazoo apologist as he struggles to google who Joel Quenville is and give us more thoughts on
[17:14.720 --> 17:18.320]  Wow. There is an idea of competition now.
[17:19.280 --> 17:22.720]  There is now a post on the TMA fan page. Doug, look at this.
[17:22.720 --> 17:23.840]  What?
[17:23.840 --> 17:30.240]  It says, 2KG. Your cooking show is great. That's an autograph of Lady Gaga.
[17:30.240 --> 17:34.880]  And it says $7,000 or best offer. So now there's competition.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.640]  He does have a very good cooking show, I understand.
[17:41.280 --> 17:41.780]  Yeah.
[19:29.460 --> 19:36.340]  each roast naked dong thanks for a great year Tim Doug that's from the JV golf coach okay JV
[19:36.340 --> 19:42.100]  golf coach thanking Tim morning hall of fame show today but nothing and I mean nothing beats
[19:42.100 --> 19:48.260]  plows he going scorched earth on listeners in the text inbox without context I couldn't agree more
[19:49.300 --> 19:57.540]  I'd get too excited to read the text he launched a full-on two front war against mardukas and beer
[19:01.320 --> 19:03.800]  You're putting $3 billion into it when you think we'll take it over.
[19:03.800 --> 19:09.680]  Well, they probably don't want to handle all the logistics of actually televising a game.
[19:09.680 --> 19:12.840]  You keep your cameraman, your directors, your producers, all the people that actually get
[19:12.840 --> 19:15.320]  it on the air and will own the product.
[19:15.320 --> 19:19.360]  But Worsen Woods-Wacko says you can operate under Chapter 11 and reorganize your debts
[19:19.360 --> 19:22.960]  with the goal to resume operations.
[19:22.960 --> 19:23.960]  I just don't...
[19:23.960 --> 19:24.960]  I don't know.
[19:24.960 --> 19:26.280]  I'm dumb and poor.
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.840]  So I get like I'm not in this like tax bracket where these guys are.
[17:44.400 --> 17:45.520]  That might have been it.
[17:46.480 --> 17:48.000]  That might have been the silver ball.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.640]  Everything he does, he steals the hat he had on the other night.
[17:50.640 --> 17:52.720]  Yeah, that's what he has been wearing that for a year.
[17:53.920 --> 17:54.880]  Cam Newton wears it.
[17:54.880 --> 17:58.240]  I'm going to wear it. I look like Moon. I mean, you steal everything you do.
[17:58.240 --> 18:00.240]  That's not the Moon hat.
[18:00.240 --> 18:01.840]  You do everything on your own.
[18:03.600 --> 18:05.120]  Isn't it more Cammy, Cammy Nunu?
[18:05.680 --> 18:09.760]  He started it. It's kind of woman at the winery hat.
[18:10.320 --> 18:11.760]  Woman at the winery hat.
[19:57.540 --> 20:04.580]  cats based on a conversation that the listeners were not clued in on and I'd like to nominate it
[20:04.580 --> 20:10.580]  for rant of the year just squeezing out Iggy berating Doug for not sharing the information
[20:10.580 --> 20:18.500]  he had about learn in the commercial she did that he hadn't used to abuse himself yet so good it's
[20:18.500 --> 20:26.180]  so so good thanks that's from the goonter agency formally requesting for a text inbox name change to
[19:29.840 --> 19:31.480]  But it makes no sense to me.
[19:31.480 --> 19:32.840]  Well, I'm out of money.
[19:32.840 --> 19:38.320]  I can't operate billion dollar businesses and say I'm just not going to pay them.
[19:38.320 --> 19:41.320]  And they go, okay, well, I'm still going to put my product on your...
[19:41.320 --> 19:42.320]  It just...
[19:42.320 --> 19:43.960]  This isn't real life to me.
[19:43.960 --> 19:46.800]  If you're a private person who gets in over your head with credit card debt or something
[19:46.800 --> 19:51.280]  and you just can't pay it back, you can file bankruptcy and you won't have to pay it back.
[19:51.280 --> 19:54.360]  It doesn't seem fair, but that's... those are the laws.
[19:54.360 --> 19:57.880]  But at the same time, you can open up more credit cards and continue to use those new
[19:57.880 --> 19:59.440]  credit cards without paying them again.
[20:26.180 --> 20:35.780]  f you mardukas and wrangle your family and beer cats the goonter agency I like the name new name
[20:35.780 --> 20:43.620]  under consideration and finally Sadie Hawkins Doug the blues got stopped six one six to one and for
[20:43.620 --> 20:50.420]  some reason the new head coach refuses to speak he's speaking I forgot about that
[20:50.420 --> 20:56.020]  Brett Hall shot a puck at one of the blues mustached head coaches 25 years ago and we're going to
[18:11.760 --> 18:14.000]  KG no time was dressed up as a woman at the winery.
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.280]  We kind of had people now.
[18:15.280 --> 18:18.480]  It's funny. He never wore it until he came in here and I'm sure he saw Moon wearing it.
[18:22.880 --> 18:25.280]  It's not like a fedora or something, is it?
[18:25.280 --> 18:26.560]  I don't even know what you call it.
[18:26.560 --> 18:28.560]  Jackson calls it a woman at the winery hat.
[18:29.120 --> 18:29.520]  People know.
[18:29.520 --> 18:31.200]  I wouldn't say that's a very good outfit.
[18:31.200 --> 18:33.040]  I've seen Kelly, our sales girl, wear one like that.
[18:33.040 --> 18:34.800]  So maybe that's where he stole it from Kelly. I don't know.
[18:34.800 --> 18:36.080]  He stole Kelly's hat?
[18:36.080 --> 18:37.040]  Instead of Moon. I don't know.
[18:37.040 --> 18:40.240]  I love that our general manager, salesman, he's called our sales girl.
[20:56.020 --> 21:01.700]  figure out which one it was John Moran at 34 points including the game winner at the buzzer
[21:01.700 --> 21:08.180]  is in return from suspension someone found Greg Oden's wean is that a new report Doug is now a
[21:08.180 --> 21:14.180]  grandfather as John Vaughn's child was born Iggy got flipped off on his way to work possibly by a
[21:14.180 --> 21:19.220]  hubbard employee but I think the lead is that Doug is reporting that learn was an intelligent commercial
[20:00.040 --> 20:01.040]  I don't know about that.
[20:01.040 --> 20:02.560]  That's what they're doing right now.
[20:02.560 --> 20:03.560]  What you can continue to do.
[20:03.560 --> 20:05.960]  It's getting into a more debt when they can't pay back their original debt.
[20:05.960 --> 20:09.280]  I don't think you could get another credit card, but you could continue to work and make
[20:09.280 --> 20:10.280]  money.
[20:10.280 --> 20:11.520]  You could do that.
[20:11.520 --> 20:12.520]  Diamond has money.
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.920]  They just don't have enough money to pay all their obligations.
[20:14.920 --> 20:16.960]  And that's where bankruptcy comes into play.
[20:16.960 --> 20:20.680]  You have to set up a plan to pay certain debts, not all of the debts.
[20:20.680 --> 20:22.820]  You can do the same thing as an individual.
[20:22.820 --> 20:24.400]  That's from a bankruptcy attorney.
[20:24.400 --> 20:25.400]  Okay.
[20:25.400 --> 20:26.400]  Well, he should know.
[20:26.400 --> 20:29.280]  Can you imagine if that article would have said they've said they're not paying three
[18:40.240 --> 18:43.440]  Kind of got shoved right there.
[18:44.880 --> 18:46.000]  She's the best.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.520]  Well, like if I wear pants, am I copying someone who also wears pants?
[18:49.520 --> 18:51.120]  Well, it's a different kind of hat. Come on.
[18:51.120 --> 18:53.200]  Not everybody's wearing that hat, Jackson.
[18:54.720 --> 18:57.440]  Yeah, but just because Moon wears it doesn't mean other people can't.
[18:57.440 --> 18:59.600]  KG no time says future wears it.
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.040]  Future also big time wears it.
[19:01.040 --> 19:02.720]  So you stole it from somebody else?
[19:04.240 --> 19:06.160]  Can say, oh, what's this? Oh, oh.
[21:19.220 --> 21:26.180]  name is very as Doug did so or last night man it's gonna be a huge bit for a long time I feel like
[21:27.140 --> 21:33.460]  I need to wrap up this email so I can get down to sex right now when they open and pick up one of
[21:33.460 --> 21:39.300]  those unisex fur coats that I heard about on the show then I need to find a gag prize for Rob your
[21:39.300 --> 21:43.700]  neighbor at the office Christmas party does anyone know where I can find a book by someone who has
[21:43.700 --> 21:49.460]  been cancelled due to allegations of sexual misconduct but hard to grab by someone else my
[21:49.460 --> 21:55.140]  budget six to fifteen dollars that's from buck swope and that's what we have for the design air
[21:55.140 --> 22:00.500]  heating and cooling email today with a nice little email thought we had three pretty good ones yeah
[22:01.060 --> 22:08.740]  uh any could be uh worthy of a victory today I'm going to go with the Gunter agency the Gunter
[19:06.160 --> 19:06.720]  Oh.
[19:09.360 --> 19:11.120]  I want to take shots. It'll keep going.
[19:11.120 --> 19:12.080]  Does that really care?
[19:12.720 --> 19:14.160]  Who are we talking to now?
[19:14.160 --> 19:14.720]  What do you think?
[19:15.440 --> 19:17.680]  Well, there's a lot of people very active right now.
[19:18.960 --> 19:20.000]  Who was I just talking about?
[19:21.680 --> 19:22.880]  I love you, Jackson.
[19:22.880 --> 19:23.760]  Drag his ass.
[19:23.760 --> 19:25.200]  That's a Brian Henshin dog.
[19:25.200 --> 19:26.080]  And he's keeping an eye on the courts.
[19:26.080 --> 19:28.960]  I'm not trying to get involved in any beef.
[19:28.960 --> 19:31.600]  I'm just saying the idea like anyone can wear any hat.
[19:31.600 --> 19:33.200]  Like you're not copied just because you're wearing a hat.
[19:33.200 --> 19:35.280]  He can, but he's never worn it before until.
[20:29.280 --> 20:31.760]  teams this year and they said we're not paying the Cardinals this year?
[20:31.760 --> 20:32.760]  I love how the list goes on.
[20:32.760 --> 20:37.600]  Within a day, you'd have Nolan Aeronado has been traded for three prospects.
[20:37.600 --> 20:38.600]  Goldschmidt has been traded.
[20:38.600 --> 20:40.000]  You don't think that's a bankruptcy attorney?
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.320]  No, these dudes are just Googling things and going, oh, you're idiots.
[20:43.320 --> 20:44.320]  You guys are idiots.
[20:44.320 --> 20:45.320]  You don't know businesses.
[20:45.320 --> 20:47.960]  Like, dude, like I'm not looking it up on my own computer.
[20:47.960 --> 20:49.200]  I was just asking a question.
[20:49.200 --> 20:51.120]  I said I was dumb and poor.
[20:51.120 --> 20:53.680]  Like you don't have to reiterate that fact in your text.
[22:08.820 --> 22:16.580]  agency who's getting a discount on my cameos what I got two cameo requests once for 1875 once for
[22:16.580 --> 22:22.260]  1333 has there been anything to do with your vote for the email probably a promo probably a promo
[22:22.260 --> 22:27.940]  code I'm not doing any promo codes yeah 1330 how do you know that Rocky needs to get out of that
[22:27.940 --> 22:31.540]  account I think you probably did just take a little a shape I mean I'll tell you what it is
[22:31.540 --> 22:37.540]  big man I'll do it for you but how do you get it for 1333 I'm not voting for anybody screw it pause
[20:53.680 --> 20:59.360]  I was just simply asking how this company can operate without having any money and
[20:59.360 --> 21:03.900]  tell teams, hey, put our product on our service, but we're not paying you.
[21:03.900 --> 21:04.900]  It makes zero sense.
[21:04.900 --> 21:09.680]  And if you think it does, did you just, I don't know what to say.
[21:09.680 --> 21:11.040]  I just, I'm so confused.
[21:11.040 --> 21:12.040]  That's all I was saying.
[21:12.040 --> 21:13.600]  I didn't say I knew anything about this.
[21:13.600 --> 21:14.920]  I wanted to know more about it.
[21:14.920 --> 21:18.800]  I would imagine they're going to stop paying the teams that aren't bringing in much money.
[21:18.800 --> 21:21.800]  And teams like the Cardinals that continue to bring in a lot of money for them, they
[21:21.800 --> 21:22.800]  will continue to pay.
[19:35.280 --> 19:38.400]  He wore that the 2022 listener engineer was.
[19:38.400 --> 19:39.840]  When did he start? Right around there.
[19:40.880 --> 19:42.880]  Well, yeah, he got the job because he won, baby.
[19:42.880 --> 19:44.560]  Chairman Steve, 2024.
[19:45.600 --> 19:46.080]  Filling in.
[19:47.280 --> 19:48.880]  No, he had got the job before he got that.
[19:48.880 --> 19:50.320]  He had started filling in already.
[19:51.040 --> 19:52.880]  I mean, he's never been hired. He doesn't work here.
[19:52.880 --> 19:53.120]  He just-
[19:53.120 --> 19:54.240]  Well, he does work here.
[19:54.880 --> 19:56.400]  No, when he comes in, he gets paid.
[19:57.920 --> 19:59.520]  When nobody's off, he's not working here.
[20:00.640 --> 20:02.160]  I guess we'll see him tomorrow for two days.
[20:02.880 --> 20:04.640]  Well, he puts in some time here.
[22:37.620 --> 22:43.620]  come on I'm going for Gunter dog no no there is one I did design air heating and cooling email
[22:43.620 --> 22:49.220]  day for the record it's Gunter's agency the Gunter agency whatever it is and he is a fan
[22:49.220 --> 22:55.300]  of when the plot just starts arguing with texters without reading it as am I and I would have voted
[22:55.300 --> 23:00.180]  for the Gunter agency because of that as well Marta whatever it was Martu can shut your mouth
[23:00.180 --> 23:04.340]  yeah shut up mark it was the title of the segment welcome to TMA shut the hell up
[21:23.320 --> 21:26.540]  But as we made reference to, there was a sports business journal, excuse me, St. Louis
[21:26.540 --> 21:31.920]  Business Journal article, I think it was last week, regarding how much money Bally's locally
[21:31.920 --> 21:33.920]  lost and it had profit.
[21:33.920 --> 21:34.920]  Even if the Cardinals are losing money?
[21:34.920 --> 21:35.920]  Yes.
[21:35.920 --> 21:36.920]  Yeah.
[21:36.920 --> 21:38.920]  Well, but then probably losing less than they are with the other teams.
[21:38.920 --> 21:41.900]  That I would agree with.
[21:41.900 --> 21:47.740]  It seems like we're just a few years away from Amazon, Apple and Meta owning virtually
[21:47.740 --> 21:50.000]  all of the media in this country.
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.360]  I would agree with that, actually.
[20:04.720 --> 20:05.520]  Is he coming in?
[20:06.320 --> 20:08.080]  Yeah, is he in? Jackson?
[20:08.880 --> 20:11.520]  He's known about it. So he would text me if he isn't.
[20:11.520 --> 20:12.400]  So I would assume yes.
[20:12.400 --> 20:13.280]  Okay, there you go.
[20:13.280 --> 20:15.120]  Well, that'll be nice to see him in his hats.
[20:16.720 --> 20:18.000]  You know he can wear the hat.
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.320]  Yeah, I mean, if you want to go through all that.
[20:20.320 --> 20:21.440]  It's already a lock.
[20:21.440 --> 20:23.760]  If you want to go through all the things, I start checking them off.
[20:23.760 --> 20:25.760]  Doug, do you want to go through all the things to start checking them off?
[20:25.760 --> 20:27.040]  You can do it quickly.
[20:27.040 --> 20:29.120]  I like kittens and bunny.
[20:29.120 --> 20:30.480]  Yeah, I do too.
[20:30.480 --> 20:31.520]  One bunny.
[20:31.520 --> 20:32.880]  I do like kittens and bunnies.
[23:04.340 --> 23:10.260]  all right speaking of getting told to shut that up Jackson are going to get told to shut
[23:10.260 --> 23:15.220]  the hell up for the next hour on 101 ESPN the program is called balloon party you can watch
[23:15.220 --> 23:19.220]  it all happen on the youtube channel it's the 101 ESPN youtube channel and then he's talking over

[21:53.600 --> 21:56.240]  Yeah, they're close now.
[21:56.240 --> 21:59.480]  They got social media surrounded.
[21:59.480 --> 22:01.360]  Elon Musk got in there a little bit.
[22:01.360 --> 22:05.320]  Jackson, isn't Amazon going to be in the bidding for the NBA's rights, right?
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.320]  Oh yeah.
[22:06.320 --> 22:11.880]  I mean, there's obviously such a huge shuffle right now with NBA and NHL and MLB.
[22:11.880 --> 22:16.800]  So tech giants, the guys who can pretty much have a bottomless bank account are obviously
[22:16.800 --> 22:20.120]  going to be the ones who are going to be the leaders in the clubhouse for that.
[23:32.820 --> 23:38.660]  going to call him I gordio I probably there it is it's all coming your way today Doug meets his
[23:38.660 --> 23:43.860]  grandson what a wonderful thing time for us to shut it down for the plot for action jacks

[20:35.360 --> 20:36.880]  What are we checking off? We have a list.
[20:36.880 --> 20:37.520]  I'm not just...
[20:38.640 --> 20:39.200]  Keep an eye on him.
[20:40.240 --> 20:41.600]  It's only $7.28.
[20:41.600 --> 20:42.240]  Cooking show.
[20:42.800 --> 20:43.840]  Got time.
[20:43.840 --> 20:45.360]  Oh, wait a minute.
[20:45.360 --> 20:47.520]  Wellington got blocked by this girl.
[20:47.520 --> 20:48.720]  Guess what, Tim? I blocked.
[20:48.720 --> 20:49.440]  She blocked me.
[20:50.080 --> 20:51.200]  You steal everything.
[20:51.200 --> 20:51.680]  Oh.
[20:54.720 --> 20:56.640]  You think he wanted to get blocked by this gal?
[20:56.640 --> 20:57.840]  Yeah, they crushed on him.
[20:57.840 --> 20:59.600]  Yeah, he wanted to get drinks with her.
[21:01.360 --> 21:03.120]  Well, it was all for some content for him.
[22:20.880 --> 22:21.880]  Yeah.
[22:21.880 --> 22:25.880]  Amazon acquired MGM Studios a couple of years ago.
[22:25.880 --> 22:26.880]  They're just going to own everything.
[22:26.880 --> 22:27.880]  Yeah.
[22:27.880 --> 22:32.040]  I mean, Disney owns ESPN and 20th Century Fox.
[22:32.040 --> 22:33.040]  They bought them.
[22:33.040 --> 22:37.320]  So Disney, Apple, Amazon, Meta, like you said, Doug, they're all big players.
[22:37.320 --> 22:38.320]  They're all by BlackRock.
[22:38.320 --> 22:39.320]  Yeah.
[22:39.320 --> 22:43.000]  Plowboy, the whole reason Amazon is considering the capital infusion in a diamond is because
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.120]  they can get in the market on the cheap, stressed or under capitalized businesses are the best
[21:03.200 --> 21:05.120]  And then he creeped her out.
[21:05.120 --> 21:05.760]  She blocked him.
[21:05.760 --> 21:06.720]  And then now he got blocked too.
[21:09.200 --> 21:09.920]  And I don't know.
[21:09.920 --> 21:12.400]  It's just amazing things that happen to him if happened to other people.
[21:12.400 --> 21:14.160]  Or people have done the same thing.
[21:14.160 --> 21:14.560]  He's just...
[21:14.560 --> 21:15.440]  That's just...
[21:15.440 --> 21:18.000]  Nobody's had their mouth spit in by unicorn.
[21:18.000 --> 21:18.880]  Yeah, no.
[21:18.880 --> 21:21.520]  No, I guess Larry Nickel didn't get that done with this.
[21:21.520 --> 21:22.960]  That was Robin feeding there.
[21:22.960 --> 21:24.480]  Following presentation.
[21:24.480 --> 21:26.880]  It's a Barrett Sports Media production.
[21:27.520 --> 21:28.880]  He's connected.
[21:28.880 --> 21:30.640]  Jason Barrett says I'd like to see you here.
[21:30.640 --> 21:32.160]  The answer is when, where...
[22:48.120 --> 22:49.120]  companies.
[22:49.120 --> 22:50.400]  It's capitalism at its finest.
[22:50.400 --> 22:53.160]  If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times.
[22:53.160 --> 22:56.200]  He who had the gold makes the rules.
[22:56.200 --> 22:57.600]  That's from the worse in Woods Wacko.
[22:57.600 --> 22:59.720]  But I do understand why Amazon wants it.
[22:59.720 --> 23:02.480]  You buy low and you, I mean, you get a big ball, right?
[23:02.480 --> 23:07.880]  So I get why Amazon, I just don't get how majorly baseball could allow their product
[23:07.880 --> 23:13.120]  to be on a service where they don't pay, you know, where that service doesn't pay the teams.
[23:13.120 --> 23:14.520]  I don't know.
[23:14.520 --> 23:17.160]  I'm sure they're all scrambling right now.
[21:34.080 --> 21:34.880]  Is that real?
[21:36.160 --> 21:36.640]  Romy.
[21:37.520 --> 21:38.320]  When and where.
[21:38.320 --> 21:39.520]  I could drop when he's doing.
[21:42.480 --> 21:43.200]  Oh, well.
[21:43.200 --> 21:45.920]  But it's gonna be a fun Thursday, Friday program.
[21:47.680 --> 21:48.400]  Morning, lovers.
[21:48.400 --> 21:48.880]  Why?
[21:48.880 --> 21:49.760]  Oh, yeah, go ahead.
[21:50.800 --> 21:52.320]  Well, Jackson will be running point.
[21:52.320 --> 21:52.800]  Right.
[21:52.800 --> 21:53.520]  That'll be fun.
[21:53.520 --> 21:54.720]  Jack does a great job running point.
[21:54.720 --> 21:56.080]  There you go, Jackson.
[21:56.080 --> 21:56.880]  Thanks, everybody.
[21:56.880 --> 22:01.920]  KG and Oton will be here with his fingers at work back there in the studio.
[23:17.160 --> 23:20.680]  They'll be working all day long to try to figure out what to do and they'll get it.
[23:20.680 --> 23:21.680]  It's difficult right now.
[23:21.680 --> 23:25.720]  These are the rocky times, but the games will still be on somewhere.
[23:25.720 --> 23:28.720]  You know, they always have been, they will continue to be.
[23:28.720 --> 23:31.240]  Even if they didn't file for bankruptcy, their app is crap.
[23:31.240 --> 23:32.520]  Oh, I like that.
[23:32.520 --> 23:33.520]  Their app is crap.
[23:33.520 --> 23:36.520]  I mean, fix that.
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.520]  This is Bally's you're talking.
[23:37.520 --> 23:38.520]  Yeah.
[23:38.520 --> 23:41.720]  So you're not a fan of the rap.
[23:41.720 --> 23:45.920]  No, I tried watching it once and it just buffered and buffered and it was all shaky.
[23:45.920 --> 23:46.920]  I said, I'm not watching this.
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.360]  Will have fingers blow hawk?
[22:03.360 --> 22:04.960]  Fingers, yeah. Fingers blow hawk.
[22:06.000 --> 22:06.720]  Fingers hawk.
[22:10.800 --> 22:11.520]  Morning, lovers.
[22:12.320 --> 22:15.040]  When I was chatting with KG at the Hot Shots event,
[22:15.040 --> 22:17.600]  I was asking if he was getting wild that night.
[22:17.600 --> 22:18.720]  He said no.
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.640]  He likes to blend into the background.
[22:20.640 --> 22:23.360]  It was dead silence as we both looked at his hat.
[22:23.360 --> 22:25.840]  He could see his own hat from his own head.
[22:25.840 --> 22:27.680]  For Kentucky Derby's sake.
[22:27.680 --> 22:29.040]  That's from Cucky the Dwarf, Doug.
[22:29.920 --> 22:30.640]  That's emotional.
[23:47.680 --> 23:48.680]  You're a Wi-Fi signal guy.
[23:48.680 --> 23:49.680]  That's good.
[23:49.680 --> 23:51.600]  I'm telling him, I Bally's app does not work.
[23:51.600 --> 23:52.600]  Hasn't.
[23:52.600 --> 23:55.400]  You know, it's frustrating.
[23:55.400 --> 23:58.680]  That's why I know so much about Cardinals and Blues.
[23:58.680 --> 24:00.480]  Orson Woods-Wacko, active.
[24:00.480 --> 24:03.680]  Plowboy, wealth is not created through a W-2.
[24:03.680 --> 24:04.680]  Think about that, Doug.
[24:04.680 --> 24:05.680]  That's the Orson Woods-Wacko.
[24:05.680 --> 24:06.680]  Probably true.
[24:06.680 --> 24:07.680]  Mine is.
[24:07.680 --> 24:08.680]  K-1 season.
[24:08.680 --> 24:09.680]  What's that, Iggy?
[24:09.680 --> 24:10.680]  Mine is.
[24:10.680 --> 24:11.680]  Most of my wealth is from my dad.
[24:11.680 --> 24:12.680]  Well, 80 were poor.
[24:12.680 --> 24:13.680]  I'm talking about real wealth.
[24:13.680 --> 24:14.680]  I'm talking about wealth.
[24:14.680 --> 24:15.680]  People that are wealthy.
[22:30.720 --> 22:31.760]  What he says is going to be low key.
[22:32.320 --> 22:35.920]  Blend in in the back by laying on the bar and having some girls spit in my mouth.
[22:35.920 --> 22:36.880]  Yeah, that's low key.
[22:36.880 --> 22:39.600]  You know, in some circles, that's considered very low key.
[22:39.600 --> 22:40.000]  Low key.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  Let me get up here, spit in my mouth.
[22:42.000 --> 22:42.800]  Take a picture.
[22:43.360 --> 22:44.160]  Is that a new report?
[22:45.600 --> 22:46.160]  We don't know.
[22:46.160 --> 22:48.000]  It almost sounds like there's bad blood.
[22:50.960 --> 22:52.240]  He stole future's hat.
[22:52.240 --> 22:53.920]  You stole Missy Elliott's coat.
[22:53.920 --> 22:55.120]  What's your point, Hoosier?
[22:55.120 --> 22:56.160]  That's from Beer Cats.
[22:56.160 --> 22:58.880]  He won in January of 2023.
[24:16.120 --> 24:20.120]  If you sell that Lady Gaga autograph for $400, I don't think that's going to be a W-2.
[24:20.120 --> 24:22.080]  Yeah, it may just never come in.
[24:22.080 --> 24:27.120]  Unless you have a really special job, it's hard to work enough hours to become really
[24:27.120 --> 24:28.120]  wealthy.
[24:28.120 --> 24:33.640]  You know, if you're a big time surgeon or professional athlete, entertainer, maybe business
[24:33.640 --> 24:35.920]  owner, highly successful business, maybe.
[24:35.920 --> 24:37.760]  One hour midday show host.
[24:37.760 --> 24:38.760]  It's pretty hard.
[24:38.760 --> 24:42.760]  It's just a salaried employee to make enough money to be truly wealthy.
[24:42.760 --> 24:43.760]  Yeah.
[22:58.880 --> 23:00.080]  Malagro to Keala Worcester.
[23:00.080 --> 23:03.200]  I didn't know Missy Elliott wore that until Learn started calling me that.
[23:04.880 --> 23:06.720]  Learn calls you Missy Missy Missy Minna.
[23:06.720 --> 23:07.680]  First time she saw that.
[23:08.320 --> 23:10.000]  Coach, you look like Missy Mr.
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.600]  I saw Learn's commercial last night.
[23:11.600 --> 23:12.320]  Missy, whatever.
[23:12.320 --> 23:13.440]  Mr. Mr. Mr. had...
[23:14.640 --> 23:15.040]  Kiri?
[23:15.040 --> 23:15.680]  Is that what he said?
[23:16.320 --> 23:17.680]  Kiri Jackson?
[23:17.680 --> 23:18.240]  Yeah, one second.
[23:18.240 --> 23:21.120]  Is that what Kiri, Kiri Irving was named after?
[23:21.120 --> 23:21.840]  Am I right on that?
[23:22.400 --> 23:23.200]  Mr. Mr.
[23:24.160 --> 23:24.560]  Was that from...
[23:24.560 --> 23:25.360]  Mr. Mr.
[23:25.360 --> 23:25.840]  Oh, okay.
[23:25.840 --> 23:26.320]  I was thinking that's the killer.
[24:43.840 --> 24:46.520]  I mean, HD2 is the way to go, but...
[24:46.520 --> 24:48.200]  Yeah, we stumble on...
[24:48.200 --> 24:49.200]  We're on the right path.
[24:49.200 --> 24:51.200]  I just didn't negotiate well.
[24:51.200 --> 24:58.560]  Hey, guys, the fact that Plowstone is asking Lix for finance talk makes me gag.
[24:58.560 --> 24:59.560]  That's from Flock.
[24:59.560 --> 25:01.360]  Plock, you asked for Mr. Lix to give you...
[25:01.360 --> 25:06.320]  I asked anybody in the finance realm that could answer kind of that bankruptcy conundrum.
[25:06.320 --> 25:08.320]  Well, that leaves Lix out.
[25:08.320 --> 25:12.480]  Well, he's playing the character.
[23:26.400 --> 23:32.720]  But Missy Elliott, Doug, as you know, was Missy Missy Minna Elliott, but in 86...
[23:32.720 --> 23:33.760]  Oh, I don't know the years, Tim.
[23:34.400 --> 23:34.880]  Kiri?
[23:35.920 --> 23:36.560]  85.
[23:37.760 --> 23:39.360]  Is it pronounced Kiri or Kyrie?
[23:39.360 --> 23:39.840]  Kiri.
[23:39.840 --> 23:40.320]  Kiri.
[23:40.320 --> 23:41.040]  Kiri, Kiri.
[23:42.000 --> 23:42.800]  Looks like Kyrie.
[23:43.760 --> 23:45.920]  I was saying I saw Learn's TV commercial last night.
[23:45.920 --> 23:47.200]  What's she doing a TV commercial?
[23:47.200 --> 23:47.840]  Have you seen that?
[23:47.840 --> 23:48.480]  One commercial.
[23:49.120 --> 23:51.040]  Well, it was a TV commercial I saw last night.
[23:51.040 --> 23:52.000]  I know, about what?
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.040]  Well, don't get mad at me.
[23:55.040 --> 23:55.760]  He's pissed.
[25:13.200 --> 25:15.200]  Anybody with any sort of insight.
[25:15.200 --> 25:16.200]  That was all.
[25:16.200 --> 25:18.200]  He had a big night last night.
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.880]  He gave out three towels and sprayed some cologne on four guys.
[25:22.880 --> 25:23.880]  He made about eight bucks.
[25:23.880 --> 25:25.880]  That's what Mr. Lix did last night.
[25:25.880 --> 25:26.880]  And all for eight bucks?
[25:26.880 --> 25:29.080]  Hey, guys, what do you consider wealthy?
[25:29.080 --> 25:30.080]  Thanks.
[25:30.080 --> 25:31.080]  That's from Jackson's Lone Whispy Pews.
[25:31.080 --> 25:33.520]  It used to be if you had a million dollars, you were considered rich.
[25:33.520 --> 25:35.600]  And now I think it's about 10 million.
[25:35.600 --> 25:36.600]  You're considered rich.
[25:36.600 --> 25:37.600]  Yeah, I would agree.
[25:37.600 --> 25:38.600]  That's the number I would say.
[25:38.600 --> 25:39.600]  Yeah.
[23:56.480 --> 23:57.360]  What did you think I meant?
[23:57.920 --> 23:58.880]  I said, what commercial?
[23:58.880 --> 24:01.440]  The one that I saw on TV.
[24:01.440 --> 24:02.160]  What is it about?
[24:02.160 --> 24:03.760]  She's selling refrigerators, what?
[24:03.760 --> 24:05.760]  I won't tell you, Kiri.
[24:05.760 --> 24:07.200]  Tomorrow and Friday off as well.
[24:08.080 --> 24:09.840]  I think it might have been something to do with...
[24:09.840 --> 24:12.640]  His text inbox just puts me into a mood every once in a while.
[24:12.640 --> 24:14.640]  I think it was a healthcare commercial, maybe.
[24:14.640 --> 24:15.680]  She was on it quite a bit.
[24:15.680 --> 24:16.880]  Healthcare, really.
[24:16.880 --> 24:17.600]  Heavily featured.
[24:18.160 --> 24:22.080]  I could be wrong there, because as soon as I recognized her,
[24:22.080 --> 24:24.480]  I stopped listening to what they were about and said, oh, there's Learn.
[25:39.600 --> 25:42.720]  Everybody say once that the salary is the drug that kills dreams.
[25:42.720 --> 25:44.480]  God, I like that.
[25:44.480 --> 25:45.480]  Yeah.
[25:45.480 --> 25:48.920]  If you want to risk it and be a business owner and put everything on the line without a salary,
[25:48.920 --> 25:50.240]  you got a chance to make a lot of money.
[25:50.240 --> 25:52.960]  You might lose it, but you got a chance to make big money.
[25:52.960 --> 25:57.400]  But if you're content with the salary to have a guaranteed paycheck come in, it's probably
[25:57.400 --> 25:58.840]  not going to be your dream job.
[25:58.840 --> 26:00.480]  That was the theme of QFTA yesterday.
[26:00.480 --> 26:05.100]  A guy who's an attorney, I gathered, said he had an opportunity to do something.
[26:05.100 --> 26:08.160]  He gave a PSA, don't go to law school, which was interesting.
[24:24.480 --> 24:28.160]  Was she as Learn or just being herself?
[24:28.160 --> 24:28.880]  Because I know...
[24:28.880 --> 24:29.520]  I think so.
[24:29.520 --> 24:32.000]  Carly does one for, I think, healthcare.
[24:32.000 --> 24:32.400]  She's several.
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.200]  She's been on several different ones.
[24:33.200 --> 24:34.640]  And she's now Carly.
[24:34.640 --> 24:35.920]  She's an actor.
[24:35.920 --> 24:36.960]  An actress.
[24:36.960 --> 24:38.640]  I think it might have been Learn, you know.
[24:38.640 --> 24:39.920]  She might have been playing herself.
[24:39.920 --> 24:40.560]  Where did it play?
[24:41.760 --> 24:43.440]  I was trying to think what I was watching.
[24:43.440 --> 24:45.520]  I guess maybe possibly the Blues game.
[24:47.120 --> 24:48.400]  I wouldn't see it then.
[24:48.400 --> 24:49.200]  Oh, okay.
[24:50.480 --> 24:52.960]  I just want to say congratulations on this nice little commercial.
[24:52.960 --> 24:53.680]  She's listening.
[24:53.680 --> 24:54.160]  Sure.
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.800]  And was asking about starting up a business and so on and so forth.
[26:12.800 --> 26:17.040]  And I can't recall where I read it or if somebody told me it, don't get addicted to carbohydrates
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.320]  and guaranteed paychecks.
[26:18.320 --> 26:19.320]  Yeah.
[26:19.320 --> 26:21.320]  Well, yeah, that's good advice.
[26:21.320 --> 26:24.480]  Well, if I sell the Gaga book, I'll consider myself wealthy.
[26:24.480 --> 26:25.800]  There you go, Doug.
[26:25.800 --> 26:27.280]  Just to get 40 bucks or 400?
[26:27.280 --> 26:28.280]  Yeah, 400.
[26:28.280 --> 26:29.280]  400 would make you wealthy?
[26:29.280 --> 26:34.280]  Where I'm sitting, yeah.
[24:54.480 --> 24:55.200]  She's not listening.
[24:55.200 --> 24:56.720]  She's on another show at the same time.
[24:56.720 --> 24:57.600]  She's on vacation.
[24:57.600 --> 24:58.160]  She's on.
[24:58.160 --> 25:00.400]  The whole show's on vacation until the new year.
[25:00.400 --> 25:00.880]  I know.
[25:01.600 --> 25:03.520]  Oh, Iggy, why don't you get a commercial?
[25:05.440 --> 25:07.040]  I did a Ryan Kelly commercial once.
[25:07.600 --> 25:08.400]  Oh, that's right.
[25:10.160 --> 25:12.080]  Didn't get any SAG points or anything for it, but...
[25:13.120 --> 25:13.840]  SAG points?
[25:13.840 --> 25:15.360]  Matter of fact, didn't even get paid.
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.000]  Well, you got to be in the SAG union to get the points towards the pension and all that.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.840]  I was going to be in that movie that's filming here,
[26:34.280 --> 26:40.840]  Steven Wildwood is now selling the picture of you at the guitar for $400.
[26:40.840 --> 26:41.840]  The way I go with her?
[26:41.840 --> 26:42.840]  I don't know.
[26:42.840 --> 26:43.840]  It's the thing in front of the fountain.
[26:43.840 --> 26:45.440]  Is that the one I signed to him?
[26:45.440 --> 26:48.160]  Could you make that into a non-fungible token?
[26:48.160 --> 26:50.000]  You could probably sell it.
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.720]  Steve, since I signed it, what do you think it'd be worth?
[26:55.720 --> 26:57.460]  Whatever somebody's willing to pay.
[26:57.460 --> 27:02.260]  But your autograph compared to some of the other megastars in the business, it's got
[27:02.260 --> 27:03.260]  to be right up there.
[25:21.920 --> 25:24.480]  but I didn't have time to fill out all the paperwork.
[25:25.360 --> 25:25.680]  Yeah.
[25:25.680 --> 25:27.040]  So you were really committed to it.
[25:27.040 --> 25:27.520]  Yeah.
[25:28.480 --> 25:29.520]  Well, if they would have called me and said,
[25:29.520 --> 25:31.280]  you want to be in it, but I wasn't going to fill anything out.
[25:31.280 --> 25:31.760]  No.
[25:31.760 --> 25:33.760]  And why would they call you to be an extra?
[25:37.040 --> 25:37.520]  I don't know.
[25:37.520 --> 25:39.200]  You man's got speaking parts in it, I think.
[25:39.200 --> 25:39.920]  He does?
[25:39.920 --> 25:40.420]  Yeah.
[25:41.920 --> 25:42.480]  Good for him.
[25:42.480 --> 25:43.840]  That segment they did in a bush.
[25:43.840 --> 25:45.440]  I guess something had something to do with checkbook.
[25:45.440 --> 25:45.760]  I don't know.
[25:45.760 --> 25:46.260]  Yeah.
[25:47.040 --> 25:47.920]  But you man was down there.
[25:47.920 --> 25:49.120]  He had a speaking part.
[25:49.120 --> 25:49.840]  That'd be very cool.
[27:03.260 --> 27:04.260]  It's fine out for free.
[27:04.260 --> 27:06.060]  If they want to sell it, that's up to them.
[27:06.060 --> 27:10.580]  I think A.G. should have trading cards, and some of them have Jersey patches of one of
[27:10.580 --> 27:11.580]  his sweaters.
[27:11.580 --> 27:13.580]  You know what I mean?
[27:13.580 --> 27:14.580]  Just like an official.
[27:14.580 --> 27:15.580]  That salmon patch.
[27:15.580 --> 27:18.460]  I would like my own bobblehead.
[27:18.460 --> 27:20.260]  Jackson's lone wispy pube is back, Doug.
[27:20.260 --> 27:21.260]  He's talking money.
[27:21.260 --> 27:22.260]  This is a fine.
[27:22.260 --> 27:23.260]  This is CNBC.
[27:23.260 --> 27:24.260]  I'm surprised we're not on CNBC, actually.
[27:24.260 --> 27:25.260]  We should be.
[27:25.260 --> 27:26.600]  Probably will be after today.
[27:26.600 --> 27:28.340]  What do you guys consider wealthy?
[27:28.340 --> 27:30.740]  Is it salary or net worth at retirement?
[27:30.740 --> 27:31.740]  Those are big differences.
[27:32.740 --> 27:33.740]  You didn't ask that question already.
[27:33.740 --> 27:34.740]  So what do you consider wealthy?
[27:34.740 --> 27:38.740]  And I would say, when I'm talking, I'm talking a net worth of 10 million.
[27:38.740 --> 27:39.740]  Salary.
[27:39.740 --> 27:41.740]  I mean, salaries are nice and everything.
[27:41.740 --> 27:45.500]  But if you want to build wealth, it's like you said.
[27:45.500 --> 27:48.260]  Millionaire used to be a really rare and big thing.
[27:48.260 --> 27:51.500]  But now there's a whole lot of people out there that have that.
[27:51.500 --> 27:53.660]  What do you think that changed?
[27:53.660 --> 27:54.660]  I agree with you on it.
[27:54.660 --> 27:55.660]  But when approximately?
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.760]  William Mason seems to be hanging out.
[25:52.560 --> 25:54.400]  Restaurants, people have seen him all over the place.
[25:54.400 --> 25:54.800]  Really?
[25:54.800 --> 25:55.840]  And he plays Jack Buck.
[25:56.880 --> 25:57.920]  I don't know who he plays.
[25:57.920 --> 25:59.040]  Who plays Jack Buck?
[25:59.040 --> 25:59.760]  William H. Mason?
[25:59.760 --> 26:00.240]  I don't know.
[26:00.240 --> 26:00.720]  Does?
[26:00.720 --> 26:01.520]  I think so.
[26:01.520 --> 26:02.800]  Is it that big of a role?
[26:02.800 --> 26:04.400]  Jack Buck is that big of a thing?
[26:04.400 --> 26:05.520]  He was a big part of it, yeah.
[26:05.520 --> 26:06.080]  Really?
[26:06.080 --> 26:07.040]  Yeah.
[26:07.040 --> 26:11.120]  He was the one that introduced the kid to all of St. Louis by having him on the air all the time.
[26:11.120 --> 26:12.000]  Visiting.
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.520]  We should get the director on.
[26:13.520 --> 26:14.640]  He's from St. Louis, I believe.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.120]  KG stole the fashion choice of wearing hats.
[27:55.660 --> 27:56.660]  No.
[27:56.660 --> 27:57.660]  Approximately.
[27:57.660 --> 28:00.660]  But 1990s, maybe?
[28:00.660 --> 28:01.660]  Yeah.
[28:01.660 --> 28:04.660]  10 million is all you're playing.
[28:04.660 --> 28:07.660]  Well, yeah, that's what I've heard.
[28:07.660 --> 28:09.660]  I guess that's kind of what I...
[28:09.660 --> 28:10.660]  That's why you really don't have to...
[28:10.660 --> 28:13.660]  I don't know if that's F.U. money at 10 million.
[28:13.660 --> 28:14.660]  Might be.
[28:14.660 --> 28:15.660]  You don't need anybody at 10 million.
[28:15.660 --> 28:18.660]  You don't need anybody or anything else.
[28:18.660 --> 28:21.660]  I'll pay Stephen Wildwood $800 for the picture of Iggy and the guitar.
[28:21.660 --> 28:23.660]  I'll pay Iggy $8 for the same picture.
[28:23.660 --> 28:24.660]  That's from the Worsham Woods Wackoff.
[26:19.120 --> 26:23.840]  Iggy stole my little nephew's most adorable petite little bugle boy of uniform pants.
[26:23.840 --> 26:24.560]  Damn it, Doug.
[26:24.560 --> 26:26.800]  What was Learn's commercial and why don't I know about it?
[26:27.520 --> 26:27.840]  Thanks.
[26:27.840 --> 26:28.960]  That's from Gunter.
[26:28.960 --> 26:29.840]  I don't work there.
[26:29.840 --> 26:31.440]  I just get paid when I show up.
[26:31.440 --> 26:32.720]  That's from Gunter.
[26:33.760 --> 26:34.960]  I have order for you too, buddy.
[26:35.920 --> 26:36.400]  Now this.
[26:36.400 --> 26:36.960]  No, he turns into you.
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.800]  There was very aggressive anger toward Doug though about the commercial.
[26:40.800 --> 26:41.280]  Yeah.
[26:41.280 --> 26:42.400]  He was so high.
[26:42.400 --> 26:43.200]  That's all.
[26:43.200 --> 26:43.840]  I just...
[26:43.840 --> 26:45.280]  I don't have all the details of mine.
[26:45.280 --> 26:46.720]  I just have treated you like a...
[26:46.720 --> 26:47.600]  I was doing something else.
[26:47.600 --> 26:48.800]  I treated you like a texter.
[28:24.660 --> 28:26.660]  So it sounds like a negotiation is underway.
[28:26.660 --> 28:29.660]  This is a money show.
[28:29.660 --> 28:31.660]  Licks only knows about credit card interest.
[28:31.660 --> 28:34.660]  That stuff really racks up quick when you're only making the minimum payment.
[28:34.660 --> 28:38.660]  Shouldn't have lived above his means getting that espresso machine.
[28:38.660 --> 28:40.660]  Doug, that's from Carlos Spicy.
[28:40.660 --> 28:44.660]  We heard some day, I think, he's going into the Hall of Fame.
[28:44.660 --> 28:46.660]  That's the worst thing you could have with credit card debt.
[28:46.660 --> 28:47.660]  I agree.
[28:47.660 --> 28:48.660]  I'm in it now and it's a...
[28:48.660 --> 28:49.660]  Yeah, it is a battle.
[28:49.660 --> 28:53.660]  Not a lot of it, but any... even a little bit seems like a lot.
[26:49.200 --> 26:51.440]  And I just glanced up at the TV and said, hey, there's Learn.
[26:51.440 --> 26:52.400]  She's doing a commercial.
[26:53.200 --> 26:54.640]  She's all over the place now.
[26:54.640 --> 26:55.760]  You sure it wasn't Carly?
[26:55.760 --> 26:57.040]  Because Carly's in the commercial as well.
[26:57.040 --> 26:58.640]  No, I know. I know the difference between the two of them.
[26:59.280 --> 27:01.440]  Carly's commercial has been on a lot.
[27:01.440 --> 27:02.880]  I see it every time.
[27:02.880 --> 27:03.120]  Yeah.
[27:03.120 --> 27:03.600]  Every time.
[27:03.600 --> 27:05.120]  And there's two or three different versions of it.
[27:05.120 --> 27:05.520]  Yeah.
[27:05.520 --> 27:06.880]  15 seconds and 30 seconds.
[27:06.880 --> 27:07.600]  Uh-huh.
[27:07.600 --> 27:08.400]  Yeah, good for them.
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.320]  Yeah, one where she's pregnant and another one where kids are sick.
[27:12.320 --> 27:12.880]  Ew.
[27:12.880 --> 27:13.520]  Yeah.
[27:13.520 --> 27:14.320]  Ew.
[27:14.320 --> 27:14.880]  That's nice.
[27:14.880 --> 27:15.680]  I don't know if I know it.
[27:16.640 --> 27:17.040]  That's good.
[27:17.040 --> 27:17.520]  I've seen all of it.
[28:53.660 --> 28:55.660]  It all seems free.
[28:55.660 --> 28:56.660]  You're going with a credit card.
[28:56.660 --> 28:57.660]  Oh yeah, 80 bucks.
[28:57.660 --> 28:58.660]  Sure.
[28:58.660 --> 28:59.660]  Here's my card.
[28:59.660 --> 29:00.660]  I don't feel it.
[29:00.660 --> 29:01.660]  Mud Puppy.
[29:01.660 --> 29:04.660]  Doug, now people are sending their money, their network.
[29:04.660 --> 29:05.660]  Okay.
[29:05.660 --> 29:07.660]  I don't even care about these people anymore.
[29:07.660 --> 29:08.660]  Oh, I'd like to hear it.
[29:08.660 --> 29:09.660]  I'm actually over.
[29:09.660 --> 29:12.660]  Mud Puppy's 20, 80s making $300,000 a year.
[29:12.660 --> 29:13.660]  Nice job.
[29:13.660 --> 29:14.660]  Yeah.
[29:14.660 --> 29:20.660]  He has $200,000 in retirement, $400,000 a house, and $500,000 in student loans.
[29:20.660 --> 29:21.660]  Am I wealthy?
[27:17.520 --> 27:19.520]  I'm sure if I had an agent, I'd have some commercials about that.
[27:19.520 --> 27:20.000]  Oh, I don't know.
[27:21.280 --> 27:22.480]  Who wants to be Iggy's agent?
[27:22.480 --> 27:23.760]  Why don't you be an agent?
[27:24.560 --> 27:25.440]  Get yourself an agent.
[27:25.440 --> 27:26.720]  I probably should have about 30 years ago.
[27:26.720 --> 27:27.280]  It'd be Clebs.
[27:28.160 --> 27:30.320]  I should have just gotten into porn like 40 years ago.
[27:30.320 --> 27:30.480]  No.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.600]  That's a fact, actually.
[27:33.600 --> 27:36.640]  I think with your acting chops, you could play a wide range of characters.
[27:36.640 --> 27:37.440]  I agree with that.
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.160]  I'm sure I could.
[27:38.160 --> 27:41.440]  Well, porn back then for guys paid probably like, what, $50 a scene?
[27:41.440 --> 27:42.080]  Yeah.
[27:42.080 --> 27:44.800]  Yeah, unless you were Peter North or somebody who weren't making any money.
[27:44.800 --> 27:45.040]  Mom's too low.
[27:45.040 --> 27:46.320]  Looks like gay porn here.
[27:46.320 --> 27:46.880]  No.
[29:22.660 --> 29:24.660]  We should take some of that retirement and pay that loan.
[29:24.660 --> 29:26.660]  I'd say not yet, but he's going to be.
[29:26.660 --> 29:28.660]  With $500,000 in student loans?
[29:28.660 --> 29:31.660]  Yeah, if you're not paying any of those off Doug and those are interest accruiting, you
[29:31.660 --> 29:35.660]  are in for a long journey, even with the $300,000 salary.
[29:35.660 --> 29:39.660]  If he has that much, he's probably a doctor or a lawyer and he's got a potential to make
[29:39.660 --> 29:40.660]  a ton of money.
[29:40.660 --> 29:41.660]  Have you watched...
[29:41.660 --> 29:42.660]  Yeah, I text in his Mud Puppy.
[29:42.660 --> 29:43.660]  I'm sure that's his profession.
[29:43.660 --> 29:45.660]  Well, he's not going to text in his government.
[29:45.660 --> 29:46.660]  Have you watched him videos...
[29:46.660 --> 29:47.660]  What's his...
[29:47.660 --> 29:48.660]  I know his last name's Ramsey.
[29:48.660 --> 29:49.660]  Dave Ramsey.
[27:46.960 --> 27:49.120]  Send your emails in the morning after at Inside STI.
[27:49.120 --> 27:51.280]  Like how design air heating and cooling email the day.
[27:51.280 --> 27:59.200]  Doug, it does cool down next week, but still relatively speaking, what a temperate December
[27:59.200 --> 28:00.400]  we have had so far.
[28:00.400 --> 28:03.120]  Design air heating and cooling will take great care of you.
[28:03.120 --> 28:05.200]  They have now taken care of Iggy as well.
[28:05.200 --> 28:07.120]  And me and Doug are clients.
[28:07.120 --> 28:11.120]  It's design air heating and cooling online at design air service.com, the official HVAC
[29:49.660 --> 29:52.660]  That's what I feel like this show is becoming right now.
[29:52.660 --> 29:53.660]  But he had...
[29:53.660 --> 29:55.660]  These same situations come on.
[29:55.660 --> 29:57.660]  If you have that much student loan debt, it doesn't matter what you're making.
[29:57.660 --> 30:00.660]  People call in to get cucked by Dave Ramsey.
[30:00.660 --> 30:01.660]  Dude, there are...
[30:01.660 --> 30:02.660]  He cucks them hard too.
[30:02.660 --> 30:04.660]  There are people that are like, yeah, I'm $800,000 in debt.
[30:04.660 --> 30:06.660]  Should I file for bank?
[30:06.660 --> 30:08.660]  His facial expression, because obviously he's getting my history.
[30:08.660 --> 30:09.660]  $800,000?
[30:09.660 --> 30:11.660]  Oh, look, I love people with a million.
[30:11.660 --> 30:12.660]  And in student debt?
[30:12.660 --> 30:14.660]  No, no, overall debt.
[30:14.660 --> 30:17.660]  $300,000 in credit card, $400,000 in student loans.
[28:11.120 --> 28:15.280]  provider of both TMA and the Tim McKernan show podcast.
[28:15.280 --> 28:17.520]  New SODE posted yesterday.
[28:17.520 --> 28:22.160]  We were live on YouTube so you can watch it as well on youtube.com slash TMA STL.
[28:22.160 --> 28:23.200]  It's design air heating and cooling.
[28:23.200 --> 28:24.320]  They're not going to upsell you.
[28:24.320 --> 28:25.600]  That's fourth generation.
[28:25.600 --> 28:27.120]  They're going to do a great job for you as well.
[28:27.120 --> 28:32.960]  Anytime you run into a furnace issue, go to designairservice.com and work with the
[28:32.960 --> 28:36.400]  great Seth Goldkamp and design air heating and cooling.
[28:36.400 --> 28:39.600]  We're in the Michelob Ultra Studios for our Mogg and S. St. Louis Acura.
[30:17.660 --> 30:23.660]  Well, I suppose if you owe $400,000 on your house still, you'd be $400,000 in debt, right?
[30:23.660 --> 30:24.660]  I don't know.
[30:24.660 --> 30:26.660]  I think they add what's left on their...
[30:26.660 --> 30:28.660]  That's how they do the calculation.
[30:28.660 --> 30:30.660]  What's left after paying their home, yeah.
[30:30.660 --> 30:33.660]  He's going on Facebook Marketplace, start selling some stuff.
[30:33.660 --> 30:34.660]  That is one of the options.
[30:34.660 --> 30:35.660]  I know that's for sure.
[30:35.660 --> 30:38.660]  There's a ton of people out there making a lot of money.
[30:38.660 --> 30:43.660]  When you see the housing, the housing prices, some of the young people moving into these houses,
[30:43.660 --> 30:46.660]  there's people out there making a boatload of money.
[28:39.600 --> 28:45.600]  Alton Toyota 7 o'clock hour Michelob Ultra 95 calories 2.6 grams of carbohydrates.
[28:45.600 --> 28:48.080]  Studio sponsor here on TMA.
[28:48.080 --> 28:51.600]  Doug our title sponsor, could you tell us about them if you would be so kind?
[28:51.600 --> 28:56.120]  That would be Brown and it would be Crouppen and together they are Brown and Crouppen.
[28:56.120 --> 28:57.840]  Local law firm been around since 1979.
[28:57.840 --> 28:59.600]  I saw their offices just the other day.
[28:59.600 --> 29:02.400]  They're down there on the hill across from Ragazzi's now.
[29:02.400 --> 29:04.040]  Beautiful new building that they've rehabbed.
[29:04.040 --> 29:07.840]  They're firmly entrenched in St. Louis and they have been for 44 years now and they've
[30:47.660 --> 30:50.660]  They don't do this, but they're out there making a lot of money.
[30:50.660 --> 30:58.660]  There's a lot of people, though, I think, more that are under that 70,000, 60,000 plateau.
[30:58.660 --> 31:03.660]  You kind of want to be or need to be really right now at this point in time, it's about 70,000, 75,000.
[31:03.660 --> 31:10.660]  The median's still like 50,000, but I'm saying there's a lot of people out there making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[31:10.660 --> 31:11.660]  Just a lot of them.
[31:11.660 --> 31:14.660]  Hey, guys, I don't want this doctor earning $300,000 operating on me.
[31:14.660 --> 31:15.660]  Thanks. That's from Big Tufts now.
[29:07.840 --> 29:12.640]  grown into one of the largest personal injury firms in the entire Midwest.
[29:12.640 --> 29:17.400]  If you have a potential personal injury case, Brown and Crouppen is the local law firm here
[29:17.400 --> 29:18.400]  to serve you.
[29:18.400 --> 29:22.020]  By local we mean that's important because you see a lot of ads on TV now with lawyers
[29:22.020 --> 29:25.560]  from out of town coming in to tell you what you need to do here in St. Louis and Brown
[29:25.560 --> 29:28.400]  and Crouppen knows their way around the courts here.
[29:28.400 --> 29:29.400]  They know the judges.
[29:29.400 --> 29:30.400]  They know the lawyers.
[29:30.400 --> 29:32.960]  They know how to get the best deal for you if you have a case.
[29:32.960 --> 29:34.780]  They'll give you a free evaluation.
[31:15.660 --> 31:18.660]  He's wealth shaming the guy making $300,000.
[31:18.660 --> 31:19.660]  Did the guy say he was a doctor?
[31:19.660 --> 31:20.660]  No, he just assumed it.
[31:20.660 --> 31:21.660]  No, I'm just assuming with that.
[31:21.660 --> 31:24.660]  You connected the dots between the debt that he still owes on the student debt.
[31:24.660 --> 31:27.660]  Excuse me, I like this so much in appointment today with Dr. Mudpuppy.
[31:29.660 --> 31:31.660]  Actually, Dr. Puppy is in another surgery.
[31:32.660 --> 31:36.660]  Or someone's wacko says, wealthy is when you can tell anybody you want to f off
[31:36.660 --> 31:40.660]  because you have created your own self-reliance both financially and spiritually.
[31:40.660 --> 31:41.660]  That's from Orson with wacko, all about that.
[31:41.660 --> 31:42.660]  This guy's preaching it, hey, Doug?
[31:42.660 --> 31:43.660]  That's about 10 million.
[29:34.780 --> 29:38.140]  They work on a contingency basis, no upfront cost to you.
[29:38.140 --> 29:41.660]  If you don't get paid, they don't get paid and they've won more than a billion dollars
[29:41.660 --> 29:44.100]  in compensation for their clients.
[29:44.100 --> 29:46.660]  They treat their clients and employees like gold.
[29:46.660 --> 29:49.100]  They've been voted one of the best workplaces for years.
[29:49.100 --> 29:53.660]  Brian Crouppen realizes that happy employees are the key to providing the best client experience
[29:53.660 --> 29:56.620]  and our own 830 recreator says his mother works for Brown and Crouppen.
[29:56.620 --> 29:57.660]  And absolutely loves it.
[29:57.660 --> 29:58.660]  And they love her.
[29:58.660 --> 30:00.580]  Brown and Crouppen very much a part of the community.
[30:00.580 --> 30:03.420]  If you think you may need Brown and Crouppen services, call the number.
[30:03.420 --> 30:04.940]  I'll give that now.
[30:04.940 --> 30:10.900]  314-222-2222 or you go to brownandcrouppen.com.
[30:10.900 --> 30:13.820]  Make sure to let them know you heard about it here on TMA.
[30:13.820 --> 30:18.100]  The choice of a lawyer is an important decision and should not be based solely on advertising.
[30:18.100 --> 30:22.460]  Past results are no guarantee of future results and every case is different and must be judged
[30:22.460 --> 30:23.460]  on its own accord.
[30:23.460 --> 30:28.700]  The Illinois Recovery Center is dedicated to providing precise and authentic care to
[30:28.700 --> 30:30.540]  those seeking help and treatment.
[31:44.660 --> 31:48.660]  But I don't know if these people realize the art form it takes to live poor.
[31:48.660 --> 31:52.660]  And so when some of these guys, if they have a lot of money and they immediately lose it all,
[31:52.660 --> 31:55.660]  whether it be bad investment, they don't know how to live.
[31:55.660 --> 31:58.660]  People like me, you know, we come from the slums.
[31:59.660 --> 32:00.660]  School of hard knocks.
[32:00.660 --> 32:01.660]  School of hard knocks.
[32:01.660 --> 32:04.660]  That street smart, Doug, that is not teachable.
[32:05.660 --> 32:06.660]  But you wouldn't live that way if you had a choice.
[32:06.660 --> 32:07.660]  Absolutely not, Doug.
[32:07.660 --> 32:09.660]  And I'm kind of exaggerating.
[32:09.660 --> 32:12.660]  But people who do live the grind to grind, paycheck to paycheck.
[30:30.540 --> 30:34.660]  Whether you've made the life-saving choice to seek help on your own or you want to be
[30:34.660 --> 30:38.620]  prepared for the other end of an addiction intervention with a loved one, the chance
[30:38.620 --> 30:42.300]  to learn about addiction recovery is available to you at the Illinois Recovery Center in
[30:42.300 --> 30:46.380]  Swansi if you or someone you know wants more information about the Illinois Recovery Center
[30:46.380 --> 30:52.060]  please call 888-472-9559 or email info at illinoisrecoverycenter.com.
[30:52.060 --> 30:57.500]  And you can check them out on Facebook at Illinois Recovery Center.
[30:57.500 --> 30:59.100]  It's Illinois Recovery Center.
[32:12.660 --> 32:13.660]  That's most of us.
[32:13.660 --> 32:17.660]  That really is an art form in that they need inflation and how things are.
[32:17.660 --> 32:20.660]  I think the majority of people live paycheck to paycheck.
[32:20.660 --> 32:23.660]  Or about two paychecks removed from being in real trouble.
[32:23.660 --> 32:24.660]  Say that's more accurate, yeah.
[32:25.660 --> 32:28.660]  Orson with wacko has just sent in his balance sheet.
[32:28.660 --> 32:30.660]  Doug, we said we were going to do that for the show finale.
[32:30.660 --> 32:32.660]  Assets, he says he has $1,000 in cash.
[32:32.660 --> 32:33.660]  That's about what you want.
[32:34.660 --> 32:36.660]  House, $900,000.
[32:36.660 --> 32:37.660]  Business, $5 million.
[32:38.660 --> 32:41.660]  Liabilities, wife listed as infinite liability.
[30:59.100 --> 31:00.740]  We'll have a sponsor here of TMA.
[31:00.740 --> 31:02.540]  Jackson, tell the people about Circa.
[31:02.540 --> 31:05.060]  Pretty happy to, Tim.
[31:05.060 --> 31:10.460]  Plenty to gamble on this week, whether it be NHL, college hoops, NBA, then you've got
[31:10.460 --> 31:12.220]  the NFL coming up this weekend.
[31:12.220 --> 31:14.060]  Plenty of bowl action towards the end of the month.
[31:14.060 --> 31:17.940]  Well, it's all available over on the Circa Sports app, the world's largest sports book
[31:17.940 --> 31:20.340]  in Las Vegas and now it's in Illinois.
[31:20.340 --> 31:25.020]  The Circa Sports app is sports betting the way it should be with big app bets, high betting
[32:42.660 --> 32:45.660]  No, that's a nice house he's in, $900,000.
[32:46.660 --> 32:47.660]  What were some of the other things?
[32:47.660 --> 32:49.660]  The business is $5 million.
[32:49.660 --> 32:50.660]  Cash is $1,000.
[32:50.660 --> 32:54.660]  And then the liability on the balance sheet, wife, and that's listed as infinite.
[32:54.660 --> 32:56.660]  Yeah, he's a little cash poor.
[32:56.660 --> 33:01.660]  You're supposed to have enough cash on hand to get you through like six months of expenses, I think, should you lose your job?
[33:01.660 --> 33:02.660]  See, I like wacko.
[33:02.660 --> 33:03.660]  Really?
[33:03.660 --> 33:04.660]  He's good.
[33:04.660 --> 33:05.660]  He's set.
[33:05.660 --> 33:06.660]  Well, that's the idea.
[33:06.660 --> 33:07.660]  That's the goal.
[33:07.660 --> 33:08.660]  Big trouble.
[33:08.660 --> 33:11.660]  How long could you get by without a paycheck?
[31:25.020 --> 31:28.860]  limits, tight Moneyline splits, and the best customer service around.
[31:28.860 --> 31:33.060]  And the cool thing is the Circa Sports app is a sports betting app made by Sports Better.
[31:33.060 --> 31:35.220]  So they encourage you to shop the lines.
[31:35.220 --> 31:38.220]  Shop around, check out some of the other Illinois sports books, and then come back to Circa.
[31:38.220 --> 31:41.100]  I'm real confident you're going to like the lines over at Circa more because they always
[31:41.100 --> 31:46.220]  strive for those tight Moneyline splits and the Circa Sports app is now available in Illinois.
[31:46.220 --> 31:50.580]  So visit CircaSports.com for more details and get ready to start betting like a pro.
[33:11.660 --> 33:12.660]  Week.
[33:12.660 --> 33:14.660]  And then what would you do?
[33:15.660 --> 33:18.660]  See me on the corner with the homeless people asking for handouts.
[33:18.660 --> 33:19.660]  Do you have a family member you can move in with?
[33:19.660 --> 33:20.660]  Start selling ass.
[33:20.660 --> 33:21.660]  Selling ass.
[33:21.660 --> 33:23.660]  Probably could, yeah.
[33:23.660 --> 33:24.660]  Sell ass.
[33:25.660 --> 33:27.660]  Guys, wacko's house is in Afton, though.
[33:27.660 --> 33:28.660]  That's from Mr. Siders.
[33:28.660 --> 33:29.660]  I don't believe so.
[33:29.660 --> 33:30.660]  I think it's in Wartson Woods.
[33:30.660 --> 33:31.660]  That's the name.
[33:31.660 --> 33:34.660]  A lot of $900,000 houses in Wartson Woods, that's for sure.
[33:34.660 --> 33:35.660]  There's some in Afton now.
[33:35.660 --> 33:40.660]  Remember, we talked about that and were super shocked about the netting from Tower T was in so many backyards.
[31:50.580 --> 31:54.900]  If you or someone you know may have a problem with gambling, call 1-800-GAMBLER or text
[31:54.900 --> 31:58.660]  I-L-G-A-M-B to 833-234.

[31:59.660 --> 32:00.660]  Get involved in the program.
[32:00.660 --> 32:02.380]  314-881-TMA5, it's EDF Group.
[32:02.380 --> 32:03.380]  Text Inbox.
[32:03.380 --> 32:04.380]  314-881-TMA5.
[32:04.380 --> 32:07.940]  Call in.
[32:07.940 --> 32:10.260]  We really want phone calls today, Doug.
[32:10.260 --> 32:11.260]  Do we?
[32:11.260 --> 32:12.260]  Yeah.
[32:12.260 --> 32:13.260]  636-900-4TMA.
[32:13.260 --> 32:16.980]  And, of course, email in for our design.
[33:41.660 --> 33:42.660]  That's part of an $850,000 house.
[33:42.660 --> 33:43.660]  Yeah, those big houses.
[33:43.660 --> 33:44.660]  That's why you.
[33:44.660 --> 33:46.660]  They're not enormous houses, but they're nice.
[33:46.660 --> 33:47.660]  Really nice.
[33:47.660 --> 33:48.660]  Good morning.
[33:48.660 --> 33:49.660]  I work 15 hours a week.
[33:49.660 --> 33:50.660]  Why don't I make more money?
[33:50.660 --> 33:52.660]  That's from Mr. Big Cream.
[33:53.660 --> 33:55.660]  Well, you're probably going to have to dig a little deeper.
[33:55.660 --> 34:00.660]  Well, there's a lot of people doing 15 hours a week that are making more than me, so why don't you not worry about it?
[34:00.660 --> 34:01.660]  I bet there's not many.
[34:01.660 --> 34:02.660]  That's not a whole lot.
[34:02.660 --> 34:04.660]  That's going to be a tough find.
[34:04.660 --> 34:05.660]  That would be tough.
[34:05.660 --> 34:07.660]  I'm starting to name them.
[34:07.660 --> 34:08.660]  Go ahead.
[34:08.660 --> 34:09.660]  Who?
[32:16.980 --> 32:22.180]  And our heating and cooling email today, Jeremy Rutherford will be with us at 9 o'clock.
[32:22.180 --> 32:24.100]  He has a hard out at 9.25.
[32:24.100 --> 32:25.100]  Doesn't he?
[32:25.100 --> 32:28.580]  I guess there's a thought process as we go 25 minutes.
[32:28.580 --> 32:31.380]  But he is brought to you by Mark Hanna of Evergreen Wealth Strategies.
[32:31.380 --> 32:34.860]  Jim Dandy, last night, I do want to spend about 25 minutes on that Blues Lightning game.
[32:34.860 --> 32:35.860]  What was your favorite part?
[32:35.860 --> 32:36.860]  Well, they got stomped.
[32:36.860 --> 32:37.860]  They played, I don't know.
[32:37.860 --> 32:40.700]  It was, I turned it on and they were down 5-0.
[32:40.700 --> 32:44.980]  I said, well, this one might be over already.
[34:10.660 --> 34:11.660]  Uh-oh.
[34:11.660 --> 34:13.660]  We're about to drag.
[34:13.660 --> 34:14.660]  Who's going to get hit?
[34:14.660 --> 34:21.660]  The beauty about this job is if you're off at 10, you could go work somewhere else from 11 or noon till 5 or 6.
[34:21.660 --> 34:24.660]  At least double your income and still be home by 6.
[34:24.660 --> 34:26.660]  Part-time jobs are hard to find out.
[34:26.660 --> 34:27.660]  They are not.
[34:27.660 --> 34:28.660]  Everyone's hiring.
[34:28.660 --> 34:31.660]  Every store, every restaurant, they're all hiring.
[34:31.660 --> 34:34.660]  You didn't even let me finish before you went on your boomerang.
[34:34.660 --> 34:36.660]  Let me reel you back in.
[34:36.660 --> 34:38.660]  Let me reel you back in.
[32:44.980 --> 32:48.340]  So much for the dead cat bounce of a new coach.
[32:48.340 --> 32:49.340]  But you know what happens?
[32:49.340 --> 32:50.340]  It's a good team.
[32:50.340 --> 32:53.460]  You're going to have games that you lose, games you're going to win.
[32:53.460 --> 32:54.620]  Most of them could go either way.
[32:54.620 --> 32:55.820]  This one could not go either way.
[32:55.820 --> 32:58.260]  They were thoroughly out beat, trounced.
[32:58.260 --> 32:59.620]  Team change to coach.
[32:59.620 --> 33:03.980]  They're probably not going to make the playoffs, even though it is just mid-December.
[33:03.980 --> 33:06.660]  But it kind of feels like this team isn't a playoff team.
[33:06.660 --> 33:10.380]  So I think you're drinking to see a lot of losses like this.
[33:10.380 --> 33:12.180]  Maybe not 5-0.
[34:38.660 --> 34:45.660]  When you get hired, you say, I want to work three days a week, maybe one weekend shift, a Monday, Wednesday.
[34:45.660 --> 34:48.660]  If you're a good employee, you're not staying on three days a week.
[34:48.660 --> 34:55.660]  They're slowly going to implement another shift, another four or five hours, maybe two weekends, maybe working Saturday and Sunday.
[34:55.660 --> 34:57.660]  They will take advantage of you.
[34:57.660 --> 35:03.660]  So a start-out is one thing, but no job will keep a consistent look on your application.
[35:03.660 --> 35:05.660]  Oh, and you need to only work three days, 15 hours a week.
[35:05.660 --> 35:07.660]  That's your stipulation.
[33:12.540 --> 33:18.580]  I wouldn't be surprised if things did not go well the second half of the season.
[33:18.580 --> 33:21.020]  You think it could be worse than they were the first half?
[33:21.020 --> 33:22.020]  Maybe about this thing.
[33:22.020 --> 33:23.980]  I just don't know how much better they can get.
[33:23.980 --> 33:28.420]  Even with the coaching change, it just kind of got some dead weight on the defensive side.
[33:28.420 --> 33:30.580]  And sometimes their offense doesn't show up.
[33:30.580 --> 33:32.860]  What are they, like 500?
[33:32.860 --> 33:34.500]  I think a game under?
[33:34.500 --> 33:38.700]  I think if they play second half, kind of like they did so far, they're right there
[33:38.700 --> 33:39.700]  for the playoffs.
[35:07.660 --> 35:12.660]  Nobody's hiring a guy working less than part-time just looking to line their pockets.
[35:12.660 --> 35:19.660]  Like, I'm telling you, part-time jobs are hard because they turn into full-time careers, if you are good and decent at your job.
[35:19.660 --> 35:21.660]  Well, I haven't forbid you work full-time.
[35:21.660 --> 35:22.660]  Well, I'm saying if you are...
[35:22.660 --> 35:25.660]  Doug, I'm not talking about my or Iggy's situation.
[35:25.660 --> 35:32.660]  I'm saying if you want just 15, 20 extra hours a week, it's hard to have a job keep that schedule consistently.
[35:32.660 --> 35:33.660]  You can't...
[35:33.660 --> 35:35.660]  They are so desperate for people.
[35:35.660 --> 35:36.660]  You can't just go, why...
[33:39.700 --> 33:41.660]  But the bottom of it anyway.
[33:41.660 --> 33:44.620]  That was just a stinker.
[33:44.620 --> 33:45.620]  This game was a stinker-oo.
[33:45.620 --> 33:46.620]  I like that.
[33:46.620 --> 33:48.860]  Yeah, that happens from time to time.
[33:48.860 --> 33:49.860]  Happens in every sport.
[33:49.860 --> 33:50.860]  You just get trounced.
[33:50.860 --> 33:55.380]  Here's what the captain said last night following the debacle by the bay.
[33:55.380 --> 33:57.820]  Alright, hit the lever, please plow, see?
[33:57.820 --> 33:58.820]  Got you, Dom.
[33:58.820 --> 34:02.380]  We talked throughout the season about going up and down from game to game.
[34:02.380 --> 34:06.820]  You see some old habits tonight or were there kind of different stuff you saw tonight?
[34:06.820 --> 34:16.300]  No, I don't think there was, you know, I'm not going to go into the old habit type of
[34:16.300 --> 34:17.300]  thing.
[34:17.300 --> 34:18.300]  I think we know we can play better in here.
[34:18.300 --> 34:25.220]  And like I said, when indigas go one nothing early or maybe two, and got to try and find
[34:25.220 --> 34:30.620]  a way not to let them get that their goal and get a good team like that, got a good
[35:36.660 --> 35:38.660]  You can't tell them, no, I can't work that and then go...
[35:38.660 --> 35:40.660]  You can't say, no, this is a mental health day for me. I already worked my other job.
[35:40.660 --> 35:42.660]  Maybe I don't do mental health days.
[35:42.660 --> 35:47.660]  Whatever you want to use, they don't look at that as, oh, I forgot I did a hiring for three days a week.
[35:47.660 --> 35:50.660]  That goes out the door after about month two.
[35:50.660 --> 35:54.660]  The move is like just doing like some like DoorDash or Uber working on time.
[35:54.660 --> 35:55.660]  Yeah, that's what I do.
[35:55.660 --> 35:57.660]  There are plenty of jobs available for part-time.
[35:57.660 --> 36:04.660]  I'm saying if you go to a restaurant or a fast food or retail, you're not sticking to that three days a week, 20 hours...
[34:30.620 --> 34:31.620]  goalie in that.
[34:31.620 --> 34:38.300]  And, you know, yeah, you got to find a way to, I guess, like I said, tilt the ice and
[34:38.300 --> 34:41.020]  stop the bleeding early and just weren't able to do that tonight.
[34:41.020 --> 34:45.780]  And yeah, we had some chances, but we only had 13 shots going into the third period.
[34:45.780 --> 34:54.700]  So we got lots to clean up and move forward and focus on a game in Florida where we know
[34:54.700 --> 34:58.180]  there's going to be no room again and gets a good team and a team that plays together
[34:58.180 --> 34:59.180]  and plays hard.
[36:04.660 --> 36:08.660]  You know, three day, 20 hours a week schedule that you want juggling your other job.
[36:08.660 --> 36:10.660]  You're just not going to be able to do that.
[36:10.660 --> 36:12.660]  And I realize, I'm not even looking at the text line.
[36:12.660 --> 36:13.660]  I know they're bashing me.
[36:13.660 --> 36:15.660]  There are so many jobs out there to find.
[36:15.660 --> 36:22.660]  I'm saying to keep a consistent part-time schedule, it's hard to find a business that will continuously do that.
[36:22.660 --> 36:24.660]  Well, can't you go in before...
[36:24.660 --> 36:29.660]  If these places are desperate to hire people, can't you go in and say, this is when I can work.
[36:29.660 --> 36:30.660]  I can't work any other times.
[36:30.660 --> 36:32.660]  Can't you negotiate that up front?
[34:59.180 --> 35:04.340]  A friend of the year end awards, Mike Claiborne, who was an attendance Doug last week at Hot
[35:04.340 --> 35:10.820]  Shots and Webster Grove, tweeted out five nothing and no one is remotely mad.
[35:10.820 --> 35:15.100]  Cameraphone lights have more fight than this bunch.
[35:15.100 --> 35:18.260]  And then two hours later, he just tweeted out, ha, I like that.
[35:18.260 --> 35:20.580]  It's like a Tavon Austin tweet.
[35:20.580 --> 35:21.580]  Killers dot?
[35:21.580 --> 35:22.580]  Killers dot ha.
[35:22.580 --> 35:25.060]  Well, maybe they can tilt the ice in Florida.
[35:25.060 --> 35:26.060]  Sunrise.
[35:26.060 --> 35:27.060]  Yeah.
[36:32.660 --> 36:37.660]  You say yes to get you in the door, Doug, but when somebody calls in or they need help, you can't just go, no, I can't.
[36:37.660 --> 36:38.660]  Well, then you move on to the next place.
[36:38.660 --> 36:40.660]  Okay.
[36:40.660 --> 36:46.660]  I say every time I go into a QT or something, it's hiring $20 an hour.
[36:46.660 --> 36:48.660]  Jeez, if you worked...
[36:48.660 --> 36:53.660]  If, you know, if they're paying $20 an hour and you got another six or seven hours, you could double your income.
[36:53.660 --> 36:57.660]  If places are desperate to hire, Doug, they're going to give you anything you want in terms of days and hours a week.
[36:57.660 --> 37:01.660]  But once they have you, more than likely, you're not just going to get up and quit.
[35:27.060 --> 35:30.420]  And then the phone lights have more fight than this bunch.
[35:30.420 --> 35:32.420]  I don't get that.
[35:32.420 --> 35:33.420]  Doug?
[35:33.420 --> 35:40.060]  No, well, I don't either, I guess, but I know where it was going with it.
[35:40.060 --> 35:42.060]  That this bunch doesn't have much fight.
[35:42.060 --> 35:47.620]  There's no one leadership, it's just a bunch of dudes.
[35:47.620 --> 35:50.860]  Well the previous two games, they looked awfully good.
[35:50.860 --> 35:54.340]  You play a long schedule in professional sports, you're going to have nights where you just
[35:54.340 --> 35:55.380]  get blown up.
[37:01.660 --> 37:03.660]  Now, you can, you have the option.
[37:03.660 --> 37:17.660]  So if they give you another shift or give you an eight or nine hour shift instead of a four or five hour that what you originally were, quote, unquote, hired for, you have no defense as an employee going, well, you hired me for this, so I'm not doing that.
[37:17.660 --> 37:23.660]  You're going to be scolded, fired, or be treated like absolute dog, the rest of the time you're there.
[37:23.660 --> 37:27.660]  So you either fall in line and work whatever they want.
[37:27.660 --> 37:30.660]  They're going to say, yes, of course you only can work three days a week.
[35:55.380 --> 35:58.940]  That happens to the best of teams and the worst of teams, obviously.
[35:58.940 --> 36:01.740]  And there's going to be nights they beat somebody like that too.
[36:01.740 --> 36:06.020]  I don't think you can throw a blanket statement over a team because they had one horrendous
[36:06.020 --> 36:07.020]  night.
[36:07.020 --> 36:10.780]  There have been other bad nights for sure.
[36:10.780 --> 36:15.900]  But I don't think you can pull out one game and say, this is who they are.
[36:15.900 --> 36:16.900]  Is this who they are?
[36:16.900 --> 36:18.660]  Or were the last two wins who they are?
[36:18.660 --> 36:20.100]  It's a combination of all that.
[36:20.100 --> 36:22.420]  Is this new coach spoke yet?
[36:22.420 --> 36:23.420]  Yes.
[37:30.660 --> 37:31.660]  I could see that happening.
[37:31.660 --> 37:33.660]  And I'm sure that happens to many people.
[37:33.660 --> 37:38.660]  But if you're desperate for money, it seems like you pretty much got to bear down and fight it the best you can.
[37:38.660 --> 37:39.660]  I mean, life's tough.
[37:39.660 --> 37:40.660]  Wear a helmet.
[37:40.660 --> 37:41.660]  I'm not.
[37:41.660 --> 37:45.660]  You got to get in there and battle it, whatever it takes to take care of yourself and your family.
[37:45.660 --> 37:46.660]  Hey, Mark, Duke is an old man.
[37:46.660 --> 37:48.660]  I'm not using me as a...
[37:48.660 --> 37:49.660]  I'm not using...
[37:49.660 --> 37:52.660]  I'm not using me as a specific example.
[37:52.660 --> 37:56.660]  I'm just saying somebody who needs a second job, I've seen it second hand.
[36:23.940 --> 36:25.740]  Poor every game, after every game.
[36:25.740 --> 36:27.860]  I haven't heard any clue, I'm just curious what he sounds like.
[36:27.860 --> 36:31.660]  You think they got the George Hendrick of hockey coaches?
[36:31.660 --> 36:32.660]  I'm just curious.
[36:32.660 --> 36:33.660]  I'm not talking.
[36:33.660 --> 36:35.820]  I haven't heard anything so I'm just curious.
[36:35.820 --> 36:36.820]  It's what his demeanor is.
[36:36.820 --> 36:37.820]  Was that just penalties?
[36:37.820 --> 36:43.580]  Yeah, I mean he took three penalties, like Buche's a good player for us and he's no good
[36:43.580 --> 36:46.060]  to me in the penalty box.
[36:46.060 --> 36:51.140]  He's got to be out on the ice, he's got to be effective that way and I think for him it's
[37:57.660 --> 38:00.660]  I've had a second job before when I first started in radio.
[38:00.660 --> 38:02.660]  I know how the game goes.
[38:02.660 --> 38:05.660]  When you're a really good employee, they want you to work the busy night.
[38:05.660 --> 38:07.660]  They want you to work more than three days a week.
[38:07.660 --> 38:12.660]  And for you to go to your boss and say, well, you hired me for three days, so I'm not going to work this Friday.
[38:12.660 --> 38:17.660]  And you don't have a reasoning for it outside of the fact you're just not going to work it because of the amount of days.
[38:17.660 --> 38:20.660]  They're not just going to go, okay, you're right, Darren.
[38:20.660 --> 38:21.660]  I'll see you on Monday.
[38:21.660 --> 38:24.660]  That's not how these jobs work.
[36:51.300 --> 36:56.020]  not only a message to him but it's a message to the whole team.
[36:56.020 --> 37:00.660]  We need guys to plan the ice, they're no good to us in the penalty box.
[37:00.660 --> 37:04.220]  So moving forward, that's the standard.
[37:04.220 --> 37:06.580]  Guys want to play, they have to earn their ice time.
[37:06.580 --> 37:09.140]  Yeah, he benched him, final 13 minutes.
[37:09.140 --> 37:11.020]  I'm miss Barubie.
[37:11.020 --> 37:13.060]  First time he spoke.
[37:13.060 --> 37:14.060]  That's not the first time he spoke.
[37:14.060 --> 37:17.540]  Doesn't sound like an intimidating presence.
[37:17.540 --> 37:19.420]  Kind of sounds like it reminds me of like Marmal.
[38:24.660 --> 38:26.660]  They're the good and the bad to that.
[38:26.660 --> 38:29.660]  Well, I guess it just depends on how bad you want it.
[38:29.660 --> 38:33.660]  If you don't need the money that bad, then you can blow that off.
[38:33.660 --> 38:38.660]  But if you're desperate to make some money and to do whatever it takes to live the kind of life you want,
[38:38.660 --> 38:41.660]  sometimes you got to take jobs that aren't completely convenient.
[38:41.660 --> 38:42.660]  You just do what you have to do.
[38:42.660 --> 38:44.660]  I'm not using me as an example, beer castle.
[38:44.660 --> 38:45.660]  Shut the hell up.
[38:45.660 --> 38:46.660]  Hey!
[38:46.660 --> 38:47.660]  Get your family wrangled in.
[38:47.660 --> 38:49.660]  Get your family wrangled.
[38:49.660 --> 38:51.660]  Come at me all you want.
[37:19.420 --> 37:21.420]  He's not giving full effort from O.O.
[37:21.420 --> 37:27.900]  It's his third game as a head coach and he's trying to set this weird tone.
[37:27.900 --> 37:28.900]  I don't know.
[37:28.900 --> 37:31.860]  Well that's true, you can't really score if you're in the penalty box.
[37:31.860 --> 37:33.260]  No good to us if you're in the penalty box.
[37:33.260 --> 37:34.260]  Yeah, very insightful stuff.
[37:34.260 --> 37:35.260]  Nobody's ever mentioned that before.
[37:35.260 --> 37:36.260]  I wonder why they got rid of Barubie.
[37:36.260 --> 37:37.260]  Get off his back.
[37:37.260 --> 37:38.260]  I wonder why they got rid of Barubie.
[37:38.260 --> 37:39.260]  You got this guy.
[37:39.260 --> 37:42.700]  Is it possible he's just saying, hey let's not take stupid penalties or we're going to
[37:42.700 --> 37:44.100]  get beat six to one.
[37:44.100 --> 37:45.500]  He's saying peewee hockey man.
[38:51.660 --> 38:58.660]  I'm just saying, in general, as society, this is not me as a specific example of why I don't need a second job.
[38:58.660 --> 38:59.660]  I'm not getting one.
[38:59.660 --> 39:02.660]  I'm saying for people that do, I've done the second job in the past.
[39:02.660 --> 39:11.660]  I have firsthand experience of how we can go from being hired for one thing to being turned into a career, a full-time job,
[39:11.660 --> 39:17.660]  working eight hours on Saturday, working eight hours on Sunday while juggling your full-time job during the week.
[37:45.500 --> 37:49.540]  You can't bench one of your top players for the last half of the game.
[37:49.540 --> 37:53.540]  Maybe that's what he has to do to get their attention.
[37:53.540 --> 37:55.380]  They made a coaching change for a reason.
[37:55.380 --> 37:57.940]  Yeah, I think guys really are disciplined.
[37:57.940 --> 37:58.940]  Come on.
[37:58.940 --> 38:03.940]  You think Cairo and Thomas would be like, okay, now we've got to step up.
[38:03.940 --> 38:04.940]  We saw Pucci's bench.
[38:04.940 --> 38:05.940]  Guys, I know you in a year.
[38:05.940 --> 38:09.940]  What are you going to do if you don't do something like that?
[38:09.940 --> 38:12.660]  What other tactic is there other than sitting him on the bench?
[38:12.660 --> 38:13.860]  What else can you do to a player?
[39:17.660 --> 39:21.660]  They take advantage of good employees, and that's not a shot against the businesses.
[39:21.660 --> 39:23.660]  It's just how it happens.
[39:23.660 --> 39:27.660]  If you're desperate to hire people, you're going to say anything they want to hear to get them in the door.
[39:27.660 --> 39:31.660]  Again, this is not any personal thing for me.
[39:31.660 --> 39:32.660]  So shut the hell up.
[39:32.660 --> 39:33.660]  No.
[39:33.660 --> 39:35.660]  Like, I don't care.
[39:35.660 --> 39:36.660]  I don't need a job.
[39:36.660 --> 39:37.660]  I'm not applying for jobs.
[39:37.660 --> 39:39.660]  That's not what I'm talking about.
[39:39.660 --> 39:42.660]  I'm talking about people in general who need a second job.
[39:42.660 --> 39:43.660]  That's what they run into.
[38:14.220 --> 38:16.740]  It's the worst thing you can do to a player is put them on the bench.
[38:16.740 --> 38:18.140]  Scold them post game.
[38:18.140 --> 38:19.140]  I guess not.
[38:19.140 --> 38:20.140]  Scold them.
[38:20.140 --> 38:21.140]  I guess not.
[38:21.140 --> 38:24.980]  Brian Henshin's not happy, but it's not with Iggy this time.
[38:24.980 --> 38:26.220]  It's with the plowhog.
[38:26.220 --> 38:27.820]  Are you effing serious, Darren?
[38:27.820 --> 38:29.740]  I don't know what he's talking about, but that's Brian Henshin.
[38:29.740 --> 38:30.740]  I don't know what he's talking about.
[38:30.740 --> 38:32.740]  I don't know what he's talking about.
[38:32.740 --> 38:34.140]  Never let you know what he's talking about.
[38:34.140 --> 38:38.260]  Just yells and doesn't give any examples of why you're kidding.
[38:38.260 --> 38:42.180]  Well, do you think I was serious when I said, oh, this is all like that.
[38:42.180 --> 38:43.820]  I don't watch the games, bro.
[39:43.660 --> 39:51.660]  I have to say, one of my favorite developments of the second half of this year is the Plowhawk getting into the text inbox and MF'ing people without reading their texts.
[39:51.660 --> 39:58.660]  So the audience has no idea what these guys are saying, such as Mardukas and beer cannons.
[39:58.660 --> 40:00.660]  I don't need to read the text.
[40:00.660 --> 40:01.660]  You know there are any on it.
[40:01.660 --> 40:03.660]  I'll give you kind of the context.
[40:03.660 --> 40:04.660]  I can't tell you what you're saying, talking about it.
[40:04.660 --> 40:18.660]  I'm just thinking, with so many jobs out there that seem to be flexible, part-time type jobs, if one of the employees abuses you in some way, then move on to the next one.
[40:18.660 --> 40:23.660]  I agree, but it's easy to say that, but if you need that secondary income with you, you're getting a second job.
[40:23.660 --> 40:25.660]  You obviously need it.
[40:25.660 --> 40:29.660]  Quitting that job, not being able to use them as a reference.
[40:29.660 --> 40:32.660]  Even if you use them as a reference, you have them on there for three months.
[38:43.820 --> 38:46.340]  This roster doesn't appeal to me at all.
[38:46.340 --> 38:47.740]  It's boring.
[38:47.740 --> 38:51.860]  So I think it's fun to kind of poke jabs at a coaching change when it's three games
[38:51.860 --> 38:52.860]  in.
[38:52.860 --> 38:56.820]  I think it does remind me a lot of Marmal where he's calling out a player and he's kind
[38:56.820 --> 38:58.820]  of just a guy, a banister.
[38:58.820 --> 38:59.820]  I don't know.
[38:59.820 --> 39:03.220]  If you get a tripping panel, just go in the tunnel.
[39:03.220 --> 39:04.220]  You're done for the night.
[39:04.220 --> 39:05.220]  Just damn it.
[39:05.220 --> 39:06.220]  I don't know.
[39:06.220 --> 39:07.660]  That's taken into an extreme.
[39:07.660 --> 39:11.060]  And the coach had just given a cop out, oh, we lost five nothing, but let's just blame
[39:11.060 --> 39:12.060]  it on a couple of players.
[40:32.660 --> 40:33.660]  To me, I've hired people.
[40:33.660 --> 40:34.660]  I've done that.
[40:34.660 --> 40:35.660]  You look at that.
[40:35.660 --> 40:36.660]  That's a complete red flag.
[40:36.660 --> 40:43.660]  So yes, you can jump around from job to job, but it might be tough getting hired at your second, you know, secondary job.
[40:43.660 --> 40:45.660]  And again, let me reiterate for the eighth time.
[40:45.660 --> 40:51.660]  Let me get in real close, put your ears right next to the receiver here.
[40:51.660 --> 40:54.660]  It is not me who I'm talking about.
[40:54.660 --> 40:55.660]  You dumbass.
[40:55.660 --> 40:57.660]  Well, your situation is different.
[40:57.660 --> 40:58.660]  It isn't me.
[40:58.660 --> 40:59.660]  I'm just generalizing.
[40:59.660 --> 41:00.660]  You're up at four in the morning to do this.
[39:12.060 --> 39:13.820]  I'm going to skate right up on out of here.
[39:13.820 --> 39:15.340]  That's what we need.
[39:15.340 --> 39:16.340]  Slimy.
[39:16.340 --> 39:18.660]  He didn't say I'm going to skate right on up out of here.
[39:18.660 --> 39:22.500]  I didn't hear him taking accountability for a game plan coming in.
[39:22.500 --> 39:25.060]  I didn't hear anything about him taking accountability for himself.
[39:25.060 --> 39:26.700]  That's the first time I heard him at all.
[39:26.700 --> 39:27.700]  Yeah.
[39:27.700 --> 39:28.700]  Well, he's a tough one.
[39:28.700 --> 39:30.220]  Can't wait to watch this guy.
[39:30.220 --> 39:32.860]  The players want to lose the games, not the coach.
[39:32.860 --> 39:33.860]  Well then get him out of there.
[39:33.860 --> 39:36.660]  Even if you have Otter on the bench.
[39:36.660 --> 39:40.500]  Even if you were just an average player or didn't even make it to the league, if you're
[41:00.660 --> 41:04.660]  You're not really in position to take a restaurant job that works till 10 or 11 at night.
[41:04.660 --> 41:05.660]  Correct.
[41:05.660 --> 41:06.660]  Yeah.
[41:06.660 --> 41:07.660]  So like this isn't me.
[41:07.660 --> 41:16.660]  My point was if I got here at seven and worked till 10 and I was desperate for money and had enough money to last for another four days, I would think about getting another job.
[41:16.660 --> 41:17.660]  That really seemed personal.
[41:17.660 --> 41:18.660]  No, you're not me.
[41:18.660 --> 41:24.660]  So I would feel desperate to get another job.
[41:24.660 --> 41:27.660]  My ass would be at QT tomorrow.
[39:40.500 --> 39:43.420]  the head coach or the manager, you're not just a guy.
[39:43.420 --> 39:44.420]  You're the guy.
[39:44.420 --> 39:45.860]  You're the guy in charge.
[39:45.860 --> 39:49.580]  And whether we have great respect for him as a player, you have to have respect for
[39:49.580 --> 39:50.780]  the title.
[39:50.780 --> 39:53.140]  And he's the one calling the shots now.
[39:53.140 --> 39:54.140]  He's an interim coach.
[39:54.140 --> 39:56.540]  I mean, calling the shots now.
[39:56.540 --> 39:57.940]  I don't remember, Doug.
[39:57.940 --> 40:00.100]  Maybe you or Tim remember this.
[40:00.100 --> 40:04.780]  What was the, it's not really an outrage with Barubie.
[40:04.780 --> 40:07.620]  A lot of people don't understand it.
[41:27.660 --> 41:31.660]  Me and Paul, they had a second job for about eight months.
[41:31.660 --> 41:34.660]  Pepper and Jeannie didn't work out.
[41:34.660 --> 41:37.660]  It was a good part-time gig.
[41:37.660 --> 41:39.660]  I'll tell you, if you're looking for one, that's it.
[41:39.660 --> 41:40.660]  Try to make some money off it.
[41:40.660 --> 41:41.660]  We did them.
[41:41.660 --> 41:42.660]  Give it a shot.
[41:42.660 --> 41:43.660]  Okay.
[41:43.660 --> 41:48.660]  Well, the better thing about working, too, is when you're working, you're not spending.
[41:48.660 --> 41:53.660]  You know, when you're off all day, I find myself doing that now on days that I'm off.
[40:08.540 --> 40:11.300]  What was people's reaction when they let Quinville go?
[40:11.300 --> 40:12.300]  Similar?
[40:12.300 --> 40:13.300]  Perhaps, yeah, disappointing.
[40:13.300 --> 40:14.300]  Not nearly.
[40:14.300 --> 40:15.300]  I do remember that.
[40:15.300 --> 40:16.300]  Not to this degree.
[40:16.300 --> 40:19.300]  Yeah, not to this degree.
[40:19.300 --> 40:21.300]  He had lost Brett Hull.
[40:21.300 --> 40:25.460]  Remember, he and Hull were clashing, I think.
[40:25.460 --> 40:27.300]  Didn't Hull take a shot at him in practice?
[40:27.300 --> 40:28.300]  He took the fuck at him once.
[40:28.300 --> 40:29.300]  That was Keenan.
[40:29.300 --> 40:30.300]  Keenan.
[40:30.300 --> 40:31.300]  Oh, no, I thought that was Quinville.
[40:31.300 --> 40:32.300]  No.
[40:32.300 --> 40:33.300]  He shot a guy.
[40:33.300 --> 40:34.300]  Keenan.
[40:34.300 --> 40:35.300]  Hull was gone.
[41:54.660 --> 41:59.660]  I'm out there spending money doing something else instead of working and making money and spending it.
[41:59.660 --> 42:00.660]  I feel like that, too.
[42:00.660 --> 42:02.660]  Well, you have the money to spend.
[42:02.660 --> 42:05.660]  That's because I worked two jobs for a big chunk of my life.
[42:07.660 --> 42:09.660]  See, look at ghost gerbil text.
[42:09.660 --> 42:11.660]  What did he say?
[42:11.660 --> 42:13.660]  The ghost gerbil.
[42:13.660 --> 42:15.660]  I'm not trying to compare you to me.
[42:15.660 --> 42:17.660]  I know you had a TV job as well.
[42:17.660 --> 42:18.660]  Yeah, I forgot.
[42:18.660 --> 42:20.660]  Doug, that had to have been a grind.
[40:36.300 --> 40:38.220]  I think it was after the 97th season.
[40:38.220 --> 40:42.380]  He won a cup with Dallas in 99 and with the Red Wings in 2002.
[40:42.380 --> 40:49.900]  Quinville was let go after they lost in, they lost to the Sharks in the first round in 2004.
[40:49.900 --> 40:53.020]  It was let go in the middle of season.
[40:53.020 --> 40:59.300]  I thought it was early in the season, if I'm not mistaken, but that early exit in 2004
[40:59.300 --> 41:00.300]  set the stage.
[41:00.300 --> 41:04.180]  Well, after they fired Quinville, he did virtually nothing except win three Stanley Cup.
[42:20.660 --> 42:25.660]  A lot of times I got home at 11, 11, 15 at night, and I was back here at 6.30 in the morning.
[42:25.660 --> 42:26.660]  I didn't want to do that.
[42:26.660 --> 42:29.660]  You got exposure, though, and that doesn't show up on a tax return.
[42:29.660 --> 42:34.660]  But you also had a wife and three kids and house and college debts.
[42:34.660 --> 42:36.660]  I don't have any of that.
[42:38.660 --> 42:39.660]  Ah, yes.
[42:39.660 --> 42:41.660]  Well, but you've got to plug away.
[42:41.660 --> 42:45.660]  If you're going to be comfortable in your old age, you've got to hit it hard.
[42:45.660 --> 42:46.660]  Too late for that.
[42:47.660 --> 42:49.660]  So you're going to give up now?
[41:05.060 --> 41:08.420]  Quinville's 2004 season with the Blues, the team started poorly and late in the year,
[41:08.420 --> 41:10.860]  was in danger, missing the playoffs for the first time in a quarter century.
[41:10.860 --> 41:13.420]  As a result, Quinville was fired.
[41:13.420 --> 41:14.980]  So maybe he was fired after the season.
[41:14.980 --> 41:15.980]  I don't recall.
[41:15.980 --> 41:18.340]  It's been 20 years.
[41:18.340 --> 41:26.060]  But either way, I can't recall, and I don't know if you can, Doug, when a manager or coach
[41:26.060 --> 41:31.940]  or GM or whatever term you would want to use for person in a position of power from college
[42:49.660 --> 42:50.660]  It's not too late.
[42:50.660 --> 42:52.660]  You're as young as you're ever going to be right now.
[42:52.660 --> 42:53.660]  You need to give it up.
[42:54.660 --> 42:56.660]  I think Doug's preaching, man.
[42:57.660 --> 42:59.660]  You're going to live another 20 years.
[42:59.660 --> 43:00.660]  I agree.
[43:01.660 --> 43:04.660]  You don't want to work when you're 85 years old, do you?
[43:04.660 --> 43:05.660]  Probably going to have to.
[43:06.660 --> 43:08.660]  But you could do something about it right now.
[43:08.660 --> 43:10.660]  Yeah, and go find a rich woman.
[43:10.660 --> 43:13.660]  Well, let's take care of me.
[43:13.660 --> 43:15.660]  That might be the best way to go at this point.
[41:31.940 --> 41:41.220]  to the pros in St. Louis was met with that level of a combination of surprise, but more
[41:41.220 --> 41:45.460]  so than the surprise, the disappointment, the Barubia announcement.
[41:45.460 --> 41:50.940]  Unless it would be Whitey Herzog stepping down in 1990, but he did that on his own.
[41:50.940 --> 41:53.740]  People were still pretty surprised by it.
[41:53.740 --> 42:00.140]  But yeah, as far as a coach being fired for product on the ice of the field, I think that's
[42:00.140 --> 42:01.140]  the case.
[43:16.660 --> 43:21.660]  If only someone would have made the effort to try and monetize that quote-unquote podcast.
[43:21.660 --> 43:25.660]  Unfortunately, Senor Cielos wasn't going to watch itself.
[43:25.660 --> 43:29.660]  That's from Cajun Hotel, former salesperson for Pepper and Jeannie.
[43:31.660 --> 43:33.660]  I can't even answer the dumbass anymore.
[43:33.660 --> 43:34.660]  No.
[43:34.660 --> 43:35.660]  It's just so stupid.
[43:35.660 --> 43:36.660]  So what's the plan to meet the wealthy wife?
[43:36.660 --> 43:37.660]  First of all, I'm not a salesperson here.
[43:37.660 --> 43:38.660]  I don't sell it.
[43:39.660 --> 43:40.660]  And you're the one at Conner.
[43:40.660 --> 43:41.660]  I've got five sponsors.
[43:42.660 --> 43:43.660]  Where were they at?
[43:43.660 --> 43:44.660]  Dead Reynolds Salesperson.
[42:01.140 --> 42:02.140]  The Barubia's brought us a cup.
[42:02.140 --> 42:05.860]  So it's always going to be that you fired a guy that brought us a Stanley Cup.
[42:05.860 --> 42:10.980]  Quinville, granted, didn't have great success in a playoffs, but his teams always played
[42:10.980 --> 42:11.980]  well.
[42:11.980 --> 42:15.860]  So I was kind of shocked when they let him go, but I don't remember.
[42:15.860 --> 42:18.820]  Winning is coaching Blues history.
[42:18.820 --> 42:22.740]  More wins than any other coach you've ever had.
[42:22.740 --> 42:24.740]  Well, maybe this guy will do something.
[42:24.740 --> 42:26.860]  Oh, God, that's not a real vote of confidence.
[42:26.860 --> 42:27.860]  That's a promo.
[42:27.860 --> 42:29.860]  You're not going to be here next year.
[42:29.980 --> 42:30.980]  Why do you say that?
[42:32.580 --> 42:33.580]  What's exciting?
[42:33.780 --> 42:37.620]  Like, I mean, if he takes in a playoffs, I guess, but like they met the playoffs and
[42:37.620 --> 42:39.220]  there's really no team chemistry like.
[42:40.460 --> 42:43.380]  You're going to you're going to subject your players to that.
[42:44.100 --> 42:48.020]  And you might as well get a high profile guy that's been recycled by six other teams.
[42:48.100 --> 42:49.620]  Kind of what the NHL is.
[42:49.660 --> 42:52.860]  Well, they kind of need somebody to shake things up, don't you think?
[42:53.460 --> 42:54.860]  I mean, is torts available?
[42:54.860 --> 42:55.860]  I'm sure you can.
[42:56.460 --> 42:57.300]  Oh, God, not him.
[42:57.300 --> 42:58.140]  I'm kidding.
[43:44.660 --> 43:45.660]  Where were your five sponsors?
[43:45.660 --> 43:46.660]  You lined up.
[43:46.660 --> 43:47.660]  You just lie about everything.
[43:47.660 --> 43:48.660]  I get three sponsors every week.
[43:48.660 --> 43:50.660]  I will say me and Iggy were ready to get paid.
[43:50.660 --> 43:51.660]  So we're waiting for them.
[43:51.660 --> 43:52.660]  Well, could you bring it back?
[43:52.660 --> 43:53.660]  Yes.
[43:53.660 --> 43:54.660]  Of course we can.
[43:54.660 --> 43:55.660]  No, it's not the salespeople.
[43:55.660 --> 43:56.660]  They try to sell it.
[43:56.660 --> 43:58.660]  If nobody wants it, what are they going to do?
[43:58.660 --> 43:59.660]  What if you were to try to sell it?
[43:59.660 --> 44:01.660]  Nobody's heard of Iggy and Plowsie and Pepper and Jeannie.
[44:01.660 --> 44:02.660]  Maybe you could try and sell it.
[44:02.660 --> 44:03.660]  It's our thing to sell.
[44:03.660 --> 44:04.660]  Go together and...
[44:04.660 --> 44:05.660]  I'm not a salesman.
[44:05.660 --> 44:06.660]  You say that all the time.
[44:06.660 --> 44:07.660]  Why don't you go sell it?
[44:07.660 --> 44:08.660]  I'm not a salesman.
[44:08.660 --> 44:09.660]  Sometimes you've got to wear more than one hat.
[42:58.260 --> 42:59.580]  Metis guy in the world.
[42:59.900 --> 43:00.580]  Meters in a Hornet?
[43:00.660 --> 43:01.660]  He is.
[43:02.060 --> 43:03.340]  Maybe that's just what the team needs.
[43:04.140 --> 43:05.180]  Quinnville is available again.
[43:05.580 --> 43:09.820]  Guys, if you had Drew Bannister being held accountable on the show today, it was paying
[43:09.820 --> 43:11.140]  plus one thousand.
[43:11.580 --> 43:15.860]  By the way, talking about his Facebook Marketplace sale was minus 500.
[43:15.860 --> 43:18.180]  But to be fair, I'm sure someone asked him about it.
[43:18.500 --> 43:22.900]  That's from Chairman Stephen Wildwood, Malaga, to Kayla Lister of the year 2023.
[43:23.180 --> 43:23.820]  Yeah, they did.
[43:23.940 --> 43:25.580]  So you're correct there.
[43:25.980 --> 43:27.260]  And yeah, no one's safe.
[44:10.660 --> 44:11.660]  We're doing a podcast now.
[44:11.660 --> 44:12.660]  Would you like to...
[44:12.660 --> 44:13.660]  No, okay.
[44:13.660 --> 44:14.660]  Thank you.
[44:14.660 --> 44:15.660]  Bye.
[44:15.660 --> 44:19.100]  I think it'd be funny bit to video, whether we call a business or actually go meet with
[44:19.100 --> 44:24.760]  a business and talk to them about Pepper and Jeannie, give us a little background about
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.020]  myself and Iggy's story, what the show is about.
[44:28.020 --> 44:33.700]  Maybe even play 30 seconds of a previous and see what that reaction would be.
[44:33.700 --> 44:34.700]  You think we'd sell anything?
[44:34.700 --> 44:35.700]  It's content.
[44:35.700 --> 44:37.940]  We didn't have any reality content.
[43:27.780 --> 43:30.500]  And if you think I really care, that's a problem.
[43:30.500 --> 43:31.260]  Hall shot the pocket.
[43:31.260 --> 43:32.540]  We got three hours to kill here.
[43:32.540 --> 43:34.100]  Keenan, I remember that it was Quinnville.
[43:34.420 --> 43:36.420]  But when he shot it at Keenan, that was...
[43:36.420 --> 43:38.100]  Somebody says he shot it at Quinnville.
[43:38.500 --> 43:40.500]  But Quinnville was fired in 2004.
[43:41.340 --> 43:43.500]  But he would have been around for some of the bread hole years.
[43:43.700 --> 43:44.660]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[43:44.660 --> 43:45.060]  He was.
[43:45.060 --> 43:47.140]  He came over in 96, I think.
[43:47.340 --> 43:49.260]  His first game was after they fired Keenan.
[43:50.060 --> 43:52.740]  That's what I thought I remembered, because I thought, how weird is that?
[43:52.740 --> 43:55.700]  And then my kitchen coached for what, 12 years?
[44:37.940 --> 44:40.180]  Mr. Lix has been activated.
[44:40.180 --> 44:44.260]  He says I can confirm KG and Otown had sponsors for Pepper and Jeannie.
[44:44.260 --> 44:45.860]  How can he confirm?
[44:45.860 --> 44:46.860]  I don't know.
[44:46.860 --> 44:49.540]  I'd be curious who they were and why were they...
[44:49.540 --> 44:50.540]  Well, Lix has never met them.
[44:50.540 --> 44:51.540]  They never met each other.
[44:51.540 --> 44:53.860]  They just want to grab each other's weans and...
[44:53.860 --> 44:54.860]  Hey.
[44:54.860 --> 44:55.860]  They use their hands on it?
[44:55.860 --> 44:56.860]  Hi there.
[44:56.860 --> 44:57.860]  Is that a Dutch rudder?
[44:57.860 --> 44:58.860]  Oh.
[44:58.860 --> 45:01.740]  If he had sponsors, they'd have been on the show.
[45:01.740 --> 45:05.060]  So what are you going to do to meet this wealthy woman that's going to take care of you?
[45:05.060 --> 45:06.060]  What's the plan for that?
[45:06.060 --> 45:07.060]  I have no plan.
[43:55.820 --> 43:58.260]  No, 12 weeks or something.
[43:58.260 --> 44:00.420]  So maybe Shanahan that shot the pocket, Keenan?
[44:00.420 --> 44:01.500]  No, no, no.
[44:01.780 --> 44:03.060]  Hall took a shot at something.
[44:03.060 --> 44:05.940]  I think I was 12 at the time, so I don't think I have any insight on it.
[44:05.940 --> 44:06.900]  It was just a rister.
[44:08.060 --> 44:09.540]  It wasn't a big slap shot.
[44:09.540 --> 44:10.220]  There he is.
[44:16.220 --> 44:19.940]  Yeah, it was the part of the show where the two dopes who haven't watched a game all year,
[44:20.460 --> 44:22.940]  their opinions and tell us what to think.
[44:23.140 --> 44:25.100]  Doug, that's Nathan from the East Side of Alton.
[45:07.700 --> 45:10.180]  There's got to be a plan somewhere.
[45:10.180 --> 45:12.740]  Maybe I run into her one day.
[45:12.740 --> 45:15.660]  Maybe she's here at the store or something.
[45:15.660 --> 45:19.460]  I hold the door open for her and I get to my car and she goes, nobody's ever done that
[45:19.460 --> 45:20.460]  for me and I'm very wealthy.
[45:20.460 --> 45:21.460]  Here's a check for $4 million.
[45:21.460 --> 45:22.460]  Here you go.
[45:22.460 --> 45:23.460]  It happens all the time.
[45:23.460 --> 45:24.460]  Well, I hold...
[45:24.460 --> 45:27.260]  Would you get on an older person dating site and meet someone else?
[45:27.260 --> 45:28.260]  I hold the door open for everybody.
[45:28.260 --> 45:29.260]  Maybe there's being an old lady.
[45:29.260 --> 45:30.260]  That's not going to work.
[45:30.260 --> 45:31.260]  I'm talking real solutions.
[45:31.260 --> 45:32.260]  Real solutions.
[45:32.260 --> 45:33.260]  You never know.
[45:33.260 --> 45:34.260]  It could happen.
[45:34.260 --> 45:35.260]  It won't happen.
[45:35.260 --> 45:36.260]  Old lady.
[44:25.220 --> 44:27.060]  He is just never happy with this.
[44:27.060 --> 44:27.860]  What was my opinion?
[44:27.860 --> 44:29.060]  What did I tell you to think?
[44:29.060 --> 44:30.180]  I didn't even know the guy's name.
[44:30.220 --> 44:31.780]  Look, I'm trying to.
[44:32.820 --> 44:35.340]  I'm trying to get some pizzazz going here.
[44:35.340 --> 44:36.580]  You think I really care?
[44:36.580 --> 44:39.300]  I don't even I didn't even know Bannister's first name.
[44:39.700 --> 44:41.700]  I didn't know his last name to yesterday.
[44:42.500 --> 44:44.580]  You do need to come down the hallway at 10.
[44:44.580 --> 44:47.940]  I think they would all just spontaneously combust.
[44:47.940 --> 44:49.780]  I didn't know if the guy's even spoken.
[44:49.780 --> 44:51.180]  You can do it as a Christmas presentation.
[44:51.180 --> 44:52.740]  Yeah, no, I did that.
[44:52.740 --> 44:54.940]  Yeah, we have two special guests today at War Party.
[45:36.460 --> 45:37.460]  I hold the door.
[45:37.460 --> 45:38.460]  Here's $4 million.
[45:38.460 --> 45:39.460]  It's not going to happen.
[45:39.460 --> 45:43.780]  An older woman took her car to her car and got her groceries in there and she was going
[45:43.780 --> 45:44.780]  to have to walk into the thing.
[45:44.780 --> 45:45.780]  I said, let me take that for you.
[45:45.780 --> 45:46.780]  Well, thank you.
[45:46.780 --> 45:47.780]  If you're looking for a money there, you got to...
[45:47.780 --> 45:48.780]  Here's $4 million.
[45:48.780 --> 45:49.780]  It could have happened.
[45:49.780 --> 45:51.060]  No, it's not ever going to happen.
[45:51.060 --> 45:52.060]  You're going to find out Schnook's.
[45:52.060 --> 45:55.740]  I love Schnook's, but Dearberg's are straws to where you're going to find that old soul.
[45:55.740 --> 45:57.580]  Who carries $4 million with him?
[45:57.580 --> 46:02.220]  Well, he's not going to have a briefcase, but maybe Iggy could have him show the balance
[46:02.220 --> 46:03.220]  on an app.
[46:03.220 --> 46:04.220]  I'll write a check.
[44:55.740 --> 44:56.580]  Hey, J.R.
[44:56.580 --> 44:57.380]  Getting plowsed.
[44:57.740 --> 44:58.780]  I haven't seen a game all year.
[44:58.780 --> 44:59.620]  Break it down, boys.
[45:01.740 --> 45:06.860]  Well, it's like two guys who've been to like one game a year, watch two or three games a year,
[45:06.860 --> 45:08.700]  and then the experts on the team.
[45:08.900 --> 45:10.060]  That to me is fair.
[45:12.060 --> 45:15.980]  We're getting the we're getting the opinion of the common fan, which is important to the organization.
[45:16.020 --> 45:18.860]  Doug, pillow stacker Mike has sent in this anecdote.
[45:19.220 --> 45:22.340]  This summer, St. Louis decided to change the course of the franchise.
[45:22.340 --> 45:24.780]  Veteran Blues defenseman Mark Burjoud.
[46:04.220 --> 46:09.500]  But Worswood's Wacko has revealed his balance sheet, Mr. Licks.
[46:09.500 --> 46:11.360]  Sounds like he's ready to reveal his, Doug.
[46:11.360 --> 46:14.260]  This is the holiday treat that everybody kind of wanted.
[46:14.260 --> 46:18.380]  But Mr. Licks says, I'm just tuning in and it sounds like we just got Wacko's balance
[46:18.380 --> 46:19.380]  sheet number one.
[46:19.380 --> 46:24.400]  I would like to see his company's financials to verify the $5 million because that seems
[46:24.400 --> 46:28.940]  like a lot for a rental car location in South County.
[46:28.940 --> 46:29.940]  You're doing serious business.
[46:29.940 --> 46:33.400]  He already said he owns a restaurant.
[45:25.020 --> 45:29.100]  Said he didn't think the team would ever win the Cup with Hall because of his selfishness.
[45:29.460 --> 45:34.260]  Last season, Hall was unhappy over the prospect of leaving the Blues and during training camp practice.
[45:34.500 --> 45:36.700]  He fired a pocket coach Joel Quenville.
[45:36.980 --> 45:40.660]  Hall was startled when Quenville retaliated and fired it back at him.
[45:41.900 --> 45:44.740]  I don't want to talk about it, Quenville said personally last week.
[45:44.740 --> 45:45.740]  Brett and I addressed it.
[45:45.740 --> 45:46.500]  We moved on.
[45:46.620 --> 45:48.260]  That's from pillow stacker Mike.
[45:48.300 --> 45:50.220]  Yeah, that's the incident that I was remembering.
[45:51.700 --> 45:52.660]  I missed it.
[45:52.860 --> 45:54.140]  I didn't see that at practice.
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.440]  Number two, there should be a liability listed for being a member of a country club down
[46:37.440 --> 46:40.040]  by the railroad tracks.
[46:40.040 --> 46:43.040]  You don't belong to any country clubs and we don't know what you do because nobody's
[46:43.040 --> 46:44.040]  ever met you.
[46:44.040 --> 46:45.420]  At least we've met Worson with Wacko.
[46:45.420 --> 46:46.420]  We know he's real.
[46:46.420 --> 46:48.600]  Old Worson have a railroad track running through it?
[46:48.600 --> 46:49.600]  I don't believe so.
[46:49.600 --> 46:51.600]  There's one by the golf course.
[46:51.600 --> 46:52.600]  Old Worson?
[46:52.600 --> 46:53.600]  Old Worson really?
[46:53.600 --> 46:55.600]  Oh, I thought you meant Elgok when he belongs.
[46:55.600 --> 46:57.520]  Number three, four figure liquidity.
[46:57.520 --> 46:59.120]  Yeah, that does track.
[46:59.120 --> 47:00.720]  That is from Mr. Licks.
[45:54.140 --> 45:55.700]  I've went at every practice, obviously.
[45:55.900 --> 45:58.220]  Hall was gone from St. Louis before Quenville.
[45:58.220 --> 45:59.460]  I don't think that's the case.
[45:59.500 --> 46:00.740]  That's from Cuckleberry Finn.
[46:02.460 --> 46:03.380]  Is that the case?
[46:03.700 --> 46:08.300]  I thought Hall left after 97 and Quenville was here in 96.
[46:08.940 --> 46:10.020]  Jackson, is that correct?
[46:11.020 --> 46:14.900]  Well, Tim, who are the players in question?
[46:14.940 --> 46:17.860]  Brad Hall and Joel Quenville.
[46:18.620 --> 46:19.740]  Quenville is a coach.
[46:19.780 --> 46:20.900]  You've heard of these guys.
[46:21.580 --> 46:22.380]  You're part of me.
[46:22.380 --> 46:23.220]  You're part of me in Palazzi's.
[47:01.480 --> 47:05.160]  It sounds like they're just trying to get a verification on the $5 million.
[47:05.160 --> 47:10.280]  He thinks there should be a liability listed for a country club on railroad tracks.
[47:10.280 --> 47:12.960]  Hey, I need to tell the people about James Carlton.
[47:12.960 --> 47:14.720]  He's by railroad tracks because he's in Webster Grove.
[47:14.720 --> 47:16.160]  He's always had railroad tracks everywhere.
[47:16.160 --> 47:17.600]  Webster Grove, downtown Webster Grove.
[47:17.600 --> 47:18.680]  Westboro has one, doesn't it?
[47:18.680 --> 47:19.680]  That does indeed.
[47:19.680 --> 47:20.680]  I've been in it.
[47:20.680 --> 47:21.680]  Show me.
[47:21.680 --> 47:22.680]  I think it's going to score me.
[47:22.680 --> 47:23.680]  Show me.
[47:23.680 --> 47:24.680]  He's on the 600 yard line.
[47:24.680 --> 47:25.680]  Part five.
[47:25.680 --> 47:26.680]  500, where the hell it is.
[47:26.680 --> 47:27.680]  Glen Echo.
[47:27.680 --> 47:29.200]  Glen Echo has Metrolink shooting on Vyde.
[47:29.200 --> 47:30.200]  That's character.
[46:23.660 --> 46:24.940]  No, because I don't have an opinion.
[46:28.420 --> 46:30.580]  So when did Brett Hall leave the Blues?
[46:31.100 --> 46:32.660]  1998, the year I was born.
[46:33.460 --> 46:34.500]  And when did Quenville live?
[46:34.740 --> 46:35.780]  What were his years here?
[46:36.140 --> 46:37.260]  Joel Quenville, you mean?
[46:37.300 --> 46:38.220]  Yes, that's right.
[46:38.420 --> 46:38.820]  Okay.
[46:39.940 --> 46:42.580]  Q-U-E-N-N-E-V-I-L-L-E.
[46:42.580 --> 46:44.100]  Boy with a mustache on this cat.
[46:44.100 --> 46:46.260]  Yeah, good player himself.
[46:46.420 --> 46:51.460]  Yeah, he ended his tenure with the Blues in 2004.
[47:30.200 --> 47:33.040]  I feel like there's a course in the British Open rotation that has...
[47:33.040 --> 47:34.040]  Peeblee Farms has a railroad.
[47:34.040 --> 47:35.400]  I'm a big Peeblee Farms.
[47:35.400 --> 47:37.560]  We had one during our boxing match.
[47:37.560 --> 47:38.560]  That's correct.
[47:38.560 --> 47:41.120]  James Carlton, 3149 614 800.
[47:41.120 --> 47:42.720]  Go online at carletoninsurance.net.
[47:42.720 --> 47:45.360]  If your insurance costs a leg in an arm, call James Carlton State Farm.
[47:45.360 --> 47:46.360]  He's my insurance agent.
[47:46.360 --> 47:47.720]  He's the Plow Hawks insurance agent.
[47:47.720 --> 47:49.880]  I recommend you become yours as well.
[47:49.880 --> 47:53.120]  Big Missouri supporter in the NIL as well.
[47:53.120 --> 47:55.880]  That's James Carlton, friend of the radio program.
[47:55.880 --> 47:57.760]  Jackson, if you could, tell me about your hair.
[47:57.760 --> 47:59.680]  Making a comeback, baby.
[46:51.460 --> 46:53.540]  But Doug wants to know when it started.
[46:53.540 --> 46:54.060]  When did he start?
[46:54.980 --> 46:55.700]  Wow.
[46:56.300 --> 47:01.140]  He became the head coach of the Blues in 1996.
[47:01.220 --> 47:01.700]  Okay.
[47:01.740 --> 47:05.340]  No, he won the Stanley Cup with the Avalanche in 96, so I guess 97.
[47:05.420 --> 47:07.060]  Wikipedia is being very difficult with me.
[47:07.060 --> 47:08.660]  He was the assistant in Colorado, right?
[47:08.660 --> 47:09.220]  Correct.
[47:09.740 --> 47:12.420]  No, Blues coach from 96 to 2004.
[47:12.580 --> 47:13.780]  What a time to be alive.
[47:15.060 --> 47:15.580]  Gosh.
[47:15.620 --> 47:17.860]  I think he was with the Panthers, of course, until two years ago.
[47:18.220 --> 47:18.660]  Yeah.
[47:18.980 --> 47:21.380]  So it was in his first couple of years that he clashed with Hall.
[47:59.680 --> 48:01.520]  Doing better every single day.
[48:01.520 --> 48:02.960]  Getting compliments on it.
[48:02.960 --> 48:04.280]  Letting it ride.
[48:04.280 --> 48:07.160]  The biggest issue I felt was my crown was thinning.
[48:07.160 --> 48:10.360]  But since I started taking the finasteride on the consultation from our friends over
[48:10.360 --> 48:12.920]  at St. Louis Hair Restoration, I've seen that.
[48:12.920 --> 48:16.640]  A big improvement there on top of the laser cap that I wear every evening.
[48:16.640 --> 48:17.640]  Super easy to do.
[48:17.640 --> 48:21.640]  It's all because I got a consultation from St. Louis Hair Restoration and now Doug, the
[48:21.640 --> 48:23.560]  new grandpa in charge.
[48:23.560 --> 48:24.560]  Grandpa in charge, they call him.
[48:24.560 --> 48:25.640]  He's like an outstanding.
[48:25.640 --> 48:28.240]  He might be a grandfather, but he's got that new dad hair.
[48:28.240 --> 48:29.640]  Just look at these wisps.
[47:22.460 --> 47:23.020]  Mm-hmm.
[47:23.740 --> 47:25.780]  It seems to be that there was some crossover.
[47:25.780 --> 47:26.260]  Yeah.
[47:27.180 --> 47:27.780]  Okay.
[47:28.740 --> 47:31.540]  Quenville was here after Mike Keenan was fired.
[47:31.780 --> 47:35.020]  They would have never let Hall go if he had shot a puck at Keenan.
[47:35.020 --> 47:36.420]  They said, yes, keep tilling it.
[47:36.420 --> 47:37.820]  I think he shot one of him, too.
[47:38.940 --> 47:39.820]  Probably.
[47:40.060 --> 47:42.140]  He shot pucks at both of his coaches here.
[47:42.140 --> 47:46.340]  He wasn't a big fan of Mike Keenan or the ice at the arena.
[47:46.660 --> 47:50.100]  They couldn't show Keenan on the big video board because the crowd was just bullying him.
[48:29.640 --> 48:30.640]  Look at these tuffs.
[48:30.640 --> 48:32.280]  This would be McTuffterson.
[48:32.280 --> 48:37.280]  Now you're not going to ever be able to look exactly like the great man, but you can come
[48:37.280 --> 48:39.720]  close if you go to St. Louis Hair Restoration.
[48:39.720 --> 48:40.720]  They'll work on it.
[48:40.720 --> 48:45.560]  If you've got a bad spot on your hair somewhere, don't just sit there and stew about it for
[48:45.560 --> 48:46.560]  the next 15 years.
[48:46.560 --> 48:47.800]  I mean, you only live once.
[48:47.800 --> 48:48.800]  Do something about it.
[48:48.800 --> 48:49.800]  Do it.
[48:49.800 --> 48:54.160]  If it makes you uncomfortable in some way or you don't ever feel like you look your
[48:54.160 --> 48:56.720]  best or the way you want to look, do something about it.
[47:50.100 --> 47:52.740]  They shot a coach, shot of the home coach.
[47:53.220 --> 47:54.380]  Did he cry afterwards?
[47:55.060 --> 47:56.580]  I don't believe he cried, no.
[47:56.780 --> 47:57.660]  He had success here.
[47:59.260 --> 48:00.140]  Not a lot.
[48:00.140 --> 48:02.380]  Never won a cup, but made the playoffs.
[48:02.380 --> 48:03.260]  He had some good teams.
[48:03.260 --> 48:04.660]  Another great mustache, Mike Keenan.
[48:05.220 --> 48:07.100]  He had kind of a pencil thin mustache.
[48:07.580 --> 48:08.220]  Pretty solid, though.
[48:08.220 --> 48:09.460]  Austin Blackie kind?
[48:09.460 --> 48:09.860]  Yeah.
[48:09.980 --> 48:12.220]  Quenville had kind of a porn stash.
[48:13.220 --> 48:16.780]  Something where like crumbs, you know, thick enough to wear like crumbs, like stick in there.
[48:16.780 --> 48:17.660]  That's a real sweeper.
[48:56.720 --> 49:00.240]  We've got a great resource right here in St. Louis, Dr. Polinga and the founder of the
[49:00.240 --> 49:01.720]  company, Greg Kraling.
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.280]  Both great guys, both patients of their own products so you know that it works.
[49:05.280 --> 49:06.880]  They're at St. Louis Hair Restoration.
[49:06.880 --> 49:08.280]  I'll give you the phone number.
[49:08.280 --> 49:11.520]  I don't know if we've given that out lately.
[49:11.520 --> 49:12.520]  314-384-2474.
[49:12.520 --> 49:15.120]  A lot of 4's there.
[49:15.120 --> 49:17.680]  314-384-2474.
[49:17.680 --> 49:20.880]  You call them, talk about it, tell them what you got going.
[49:20.880 --> 49:22.360]  They have all kinds of solutions.
[48:18.540 --> 48:21.700]  All these crazy alien stories can't be true, can they?
[48:21.700 --> 48:24.860]  Hey, Steven Deener hosted the Unidentified Alien podcast.
[48:24.860 --> 48:34.180]  And whether you're new to the conversation or have been looking into it for years, you need to check out the fastest growing alien show out there, the Unidentified Alien podcast or UAP for short.
[48:34.180 --> 48:37.940]  There's a crazy amount of alien encounter stories out there from all over the world.
[48:37.940 --> 48:41.940]  And the beauty of it is that I bring them all to you and that you decide what you believe.
[48:41.940 --> 48:45.620]  Download and subscribe to UAP on any of the major podcasting platforms.
[49:22.360 --> 49:27.640]  For me it was the FUE procedure where they actually extract hair follicles from one part
[49:27.640 --> 49:30.280]  of your head and move it to the front, which worked for me.
[49:30.280 --> 49:34.560]  I'm about 6 months out and they said it would be about a year before you see the total finished
[49:34.560 --> 49:35.560]  product.
[49:35.560 --> 49:38.440]  If you go to their website, St. Louis Hair Restoration dot com, look at some of their
[49:38.440 --> 49:39.600]  before and after pictures.
[49:39.600 --> 49:43.800]  You will be blown away at the difference that it makes for some people.
[49:43.800 --> 49:48.280]  Do yourself a favor, at least look into it and see what they can do for you because Jax
[49:48.280 --> 49:51.640]  and I both like the results we're getting and I'm sure you will too.
[48:45.620 --> 48:48.580]  And you can also find it on UAPPodcast.com.
[48:51.940 --> 48:54.420]  Well, I think the listeners are enjoying the program.
[48:54.700 --> 48:59.420]  If we've exhausted that topic, let me say that congratulations to John Vaughn, who had his child last night.
[48:59.420 --> 49:00.260]  Oh, my God.
[49:00.260 --> 49:01.300]  Oh, baby.
[49:01.300 --> 49:02.420]  Holy crap.
[49:02.420 --> 49:03.340]  Gordon Douglas.
[49:03.340 --> 49:04.300]  Here he is on YouTube.
[49:04.300 --> 49:05.060]  I love that.
[49:05.060 --> 49:06.260]  Gordon Douglas is the name.
[49:06.260 --> 49:07.100]  Gordon Douglas.
[49:07.100 --> 49:08.020]  Oh, that's outstanding.
[49:08.020 --> 49:09.780]  Were you able to go there last night of you?
[49:09.780 --> 49:10.340]  No.
[49:11.340 --> 49:11.740]  No.
[49:12.260 --> 49:14.620]  The labor lasted a long time.
[49:14.620 --> 49:15.100]  Yeah.
[49:51.640 --> 49:55.280]  These for Tots, an annual toy drive put on by the Marine Corps to help give deserving
[49:55.280 --> 50:00.000]  children the magical experience of Christmas that they otherwise would not get and they
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.120]  are conducting that drive at Longo Biggs.
[50:03.120 --> 50:07.520]  Toys can either be dropped off or shipped to their office at 3828 South Lindbergh Boulevard,
[50:07.520 --> 50:08.520]  Suite 116.
[50:08.520 --> 50:11.680]  St. Louis, Missouri 63127.
[50:11.680 --> 50:14.880]  If you are injured in a car accident and you need an attorney, you need the best one you
[50:14.880 --> 50:15.880]  can find.
[50:15.880 --> 50:19.160]  If any of my family or friends are ever injured in an accident, I want them to call Doug Biggs
[49:15.100 --> 49:16.100]  See you in St. Louis.
[49:16.580 --> 49:17.580]  He is, yeah.
[49:17.580 --> 49:19.220]  Because one of yours lives in Florida, right?
[49:19.220 --> 49:19.740]  Yes.
[49:19.740 --> 49:19.980]  Okay.
[49:19.980 --> 49:20.580]  I wasn't sure which one.
[49:20.580 --> 49:21.500]  It's great, Vaughn.
[49:21.500 --> 49:22.300]  That's awesome.
[49:22.780 --> 49:23.980]  That's outstanding.
[49:23.980 --> 49:24.740]  She's a grandpa.
[49:24.740 --> 49:26.500]  Grandfather for the first time, yeah.
[49:26.500 --> 49:27.260]  That makes you feel old.
[49:27.260 --> 49:28.900]  What are you going to see today?
[49:28.900 --> 49:29.380]  Yeah.
[49:29.380 --> 49:31.780]  Yeah, I got a sound story after this and then we'll go.
[49:31.780 --> 49:33.580]  That is outstanding.
[49:33.580 --> 49:34.220]  How about that?
[49:34.220 --> 49:35.020]  How's everybody doing?
[49:35.020 --> 49:35.420]  We're excited.
[49:35.420 --> 49:36.620]  Everyone's doing great.
[49:36.620 --> 49:37.620]  Everyone's doing fine.
[49:37.620 --> 49:38.700]  Gordon Douglas.
[49:38.700 --> 49:39.740]  Gordon Douglas.
[49:39.740 --> 49:40.540]  Gordy.
[49:41.260 --> 49:43.580]  Gordon, after Gordon Bombay or Gordy Howe, I'm not sure.
[49:43.580 --> 49:44.940]  Probably Gordy Howe, I would think.
[50:19.160 --> 50:23.000]  and CD Longo at Longo Biggs Injury Law.
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.320]  In a personal injury case, there can be a substantial amount of money on the line and
[50:26.320 --> 50:29.320]  these guys know how to get every last dollar possible.
[50:29.320 --> 50:31.040]  They're smart, they're tough and they're aggressive.
[50:31.040 --> 50:35.160]  They routinely get high dollar settlements, $100,000, $500,000, a million dollar settlements,
[50:35.160 --> 50:36.160]  you name it.
[50:36.160 --> 50:37.880]  They've gotten it while fighting for their clients.
[50:37.880 --> 50:43.160]  Go to longobigs.com, L-O-N-G-O-B-I-G-G-S dot com.
[50:43.160 --> 50:47.000]  Remember, the choice of a lawyer is an important decision and should not be based solely on
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.880]  advertisements.
[49:44.940 --> 49:45.740]  Big old cheeks.
[49:45.740 --> 49:46.660]  Look at those cheeks.
[49:46.660 --> 49:47.580]  Look at that.
[49:47.580 --> 49:48.220]  Look at that.
[49:48.220 --> 49:49.100]  Douglas is after you.
[49:49.100 --> 49:50.260]  Is there Gordon in your family?
[49:50.260 --> 49:52.460]  Well, John is also John Douglas.
[49:52.460 --> 49:53.220]  Okay.
[49:53.220 --> 49:54.260]  It could be me or him.
[49:56.540 --> 49:58.700]  I guess I prefer it to be after me.
[49:59.500 --> 50:01.980]  Yeah, I'm going to call it Douglas Gordon.
[50:02.340 --> 50:03.220]  You sure could have.
[50:03.220 --> 50:05.340]  I'll address that today when I see him.
[50:06.500 --> 50:08.140]  That kind of sounds like a full name though.
[50:08.140 --> 50:08.940]  Douglas Gordon.
[50:08.940 --> 50:10.260]  I'd like Gordon to give you the last name.
[50:10.260 --> 50:10.780]  Yeah.
[50:11.740 --> 50:13.660]  Guys, Doug is officially a gilf.
[50:48.880 --> 50:52.000]  All these crazy alien stories can't be true, can they?

[50:15.500 --> 50:16.140]  Sent that in.
[50:16.140 --> 50:16.340]  Yeah.
[50:16.340 --> 50:17.980]  A lot of people can't believe I'm a grandfather.
[50:17.980 --> 50:19.740]  You know, 37 years old.
[50:19.740 --> 50:20.540]  37.
[50:20.540 --> 50:21.740]  Now, people are just grandfathers.
[50:21.740 --> 50:22.540]  37.
[50:22.540 --> 50:23.500]  37 and a grandfather.
[50:23.500 --> 50:24.020]  Yeah.
[50:26.860 --> 50:27.340]  Yeah.
[50:27.340 --> 50:27.980]  Nice.
[50:27.980 --> 50:29.100]  Oh, congratulations to that, John.
[50:29.100 --> 50:29.980]  That is outstanding.
[50:29.980 --> 50:31.100]  That's fantastic, Doug.
[50:31.100 --> 50:32.540]  Congratulations to them.
[50:32.540 --> 50:33.340]  It.
[50:33.340 --> 50:34.220]  What the F.
[50:34.220 --> 50:35.500]  That's from Brian Henschen.
[50:38.060 --> 50:38.540]  What?
[50:38.540 --> 50:39.340]  You said It.
[50:39.340 --> 50:39.980]  I don't know.
[50:39.980 --> 50:41.100]  You said they should have called It.
[50:41.100 --> 50:42.140]  You're talking about the Addams family.
[51:19.640 --> 51:21.560]  Jeremy Rutherford is going to join us.
[51:21.560 --> 51:27.800]  Doug talked about last night's magic that was the blues and Tampa Bay Lightning.
[51:27.800 --> 51:29.600]  He's presented to you by Mark Hanna.
[51:29.600 --> 51:30.920]  Jackson, should we do that now?
[51:30.920 --> 51:32.400]  Yeah, it's a good call.
[51:32.400 --> 51:33.400]  We can do it.
[51:33.400 --> 51:34.400]  I can call JR right now.
[51:34.400 --> 51:35.400]  We can bring Mark Hanna to the studio.
[51:35.400 --> 51:36.400]  Mark Hanna is here.
[51:36.400 --> 51:37.400]  Yeah.
[51:37.400 --> 51:39.400]  For holiday Yuletide spirits.
[51:39.400 --> 51:42.640]  Yeah, because if you could grab him real quick, so I can call JR.
[51:42.640 --> 51:44.000]  He's on his way out there, Jackson.
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.000]  Beautiful.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.200]  Send your emails in design here, heating and cooling email that they come in your way,
[50:42.300 --> 50:42.700]  It.
[50:42.700 --> 50:44.700]  Douglas Gordon instead of Gordon Douglas.
[50:45.900 --> 50:46.620]  Most would...
[50:46.620 --> 50:48.620]  His pronouns are going to be he, him.
[50:48.620 --> 50:49.980]  Is that on his Twitter?
[50:49.980 --> 50:51.020]  Well, they haven't announced it yet,
[50:51.020 --> 50:52.060]  but I will be telling them that.
[50:52.060 --> 50:53.820]  Well, I didn't know what his pronouns were,
[50:53.820 --> 50:56.700]  so I didn't want to say anything.
[50:56.700 --> 50:58.700]  So I didn't want to say it.
[50:58.700 --> 51:00.620]  You know, people got ridiculed
[51:00.620 --> 51:01.980]  when they put those things in their car.
[51:03.180 --> 51:04.220]  I guess it was abortion.
[51:06.060 --> 51:06.860]  It's not...
[51:06.860 --> 51:09.020]  It's a child or something like that.
[51:09.020 --> 51:09.900]  And somebody, well, if it's a child,
[51:09.900 --> 51:10.780]  why are you calling it It?
[51:47.200 --> 51:49.320]  in about 33 minutes.
[51:49.320 --> 51:50.680]  Then Jackson, I'll go down to hallway.
[51:50.680 --> 51:52.640]  We'll deal with it for a little bit.
[51:52.640 --> 51:55.720]  It's an hour and they weren't happy yesterday when Jackson and I said we thought the best
[51:55.720 --> 52:01.040]  St. Louis sports moment of the year was Harrison Meeves' 61 yard field goal.
[52:01.040 --> 52:02.960]  How are you with that?
[52:02.960 --> 52:07.000]  Well, soccer fans thought it was the opener for...
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  Oh, Jesus.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.480]  Well, that's kind of different than the opener as opposed to that one big play.
[52:11.480 --> 52:13.600]  Yeah, it depends on if your view is the...
[52:13.600 --> 52:16.800]  And then I said, I thought Cody Schrader was the St. Louis sports person.
[51:11.580 --> 51:12.540]  Well, who's calling it It?
[51:12.540 --> 51:13.420]  So they replayed.
[51:13.420 --> 51:17.260]  They rechanged those bumper stickers
[51:17.260 --> 51:17.980]  to get the It out there.
[51:17.980 --> 51:18.540]  Hello, Vivian?
[51:19.180 --> 51:19.420]  Oh.
[51:21.260 --> 51:21.820]  Okay.
[51:21.820 --> 51:22.940]  I don't know what the wording was,
[51:22.940 --> 51:24.220]  but they called the baby an It.
[51:26.060 --> 51:27.340]  So people are in the uproar over...
[51:28.860 --> 51:30.300]  People get into an uproar over
[51:30.300 --> 51:31.820]  just about anything anymore.
[51:31.820 --> 51:33.020]  Yeah, I didn't mean anything by it.
[51:33.020 --> 51:33.340]  I just...
[51:34.780 --> 51:35.820]  I didn't know the pronouns yet,
[51:35.820 --> 51:37.660]  so I just said I'd be safe with it.
[51:37.660 --> 51:38.300]  Viva la strobe!
[51:39.900 --> 51:40.540]  It's fine.
[52:16.800 --> 52:17.800]  Arcana joints.
[52:17.800 --> 52:18.800]  Look at his tufts.
[52:18.800 --> 52:19.800]  Oh, hey, Maggie.
[52:19.800 --> 52:20.800]  Hi.
[52:20.800 --> 52:21.800]  The great Maggie's here.
[52:21.800 --> 52:22.800]  Yeah.
[52:22.800 --> 52:23.800]  No, Maggie.
[52:23.800 --> 52:24.800]  Seeing some female marriage.
[52:24.800 --> 52:25.800]  Four or five different Hall of Fame's now.
[52:25.800 --> 52:26.800]  Six.
[52:26.800 --> 52:27.800]  Seven.
[52:27.800 --> 52:28.800]  Seven Hall of Fame.
[52:28.800 --> 52:29.800]  Josh, there's another one every week.
[52:29.800 --> 52:30.800]  Oh.
[52:30.800 --> 52:33.440]  You don't want to be on the camera on this operation.
[52:33.440 --> 52:34.440]  Prag.
[52:34.440 --> 52:35.560]  Maggie.
[52:35.560 --> 52:37.200]  She's not Maggie Tazlowski anymore, does she?
[52:37.200 --> 52:38.200]  No, what is it now?
[52:38.200 --> 52:39.200]  It's the last name.
[52:39.200 --> 52:40.200]  Coles.
[52:40.200 --> 52:41.200]  Coles, yeah.
[52:41.200 --> 52:42.200]  Maggie Coles, Jr.
[52:42.200 --> 52:43.200]  Mary Darnell.
[52:43.200 --> 52:44.200]  Oh, I'll be darned.
[52:44.200 --> 52:45.200]  Okay.
[51:41.660 --> 51:43.180]  Did they ask what the pronouns want to be?
[51:43.180 --> 51:43.820]  Yeah.
[51:43.820 --> 51:45.100]  Have you tended to that?
[51:45.100 --> 51:45.260]  No.
[51:45.260 --> 51:47.180]  Oh, no.
[51:47.180 --> 51:48.620]  Did he know he was having a son,
[51:48.620 --> 51:49.740]  or did they find out?
[51:49.740 --> 51:50.620]  No, they didn't tell us.
[51:50.620 --> 51:51.500]  They didn't know.
[51:51.500 --> 51:52.540]  So they didn't know either.
[51:52.540 --> 51:53.420]  They said they didn't know.
[51:54.140 --> 51:55.100]  Sounds like you're suspicious.
[51:55.100 --> 51:56.460]  We didn't know until last night.
[51:56.460 --> 51:57.500]  Well, I don't know.
[51:57.500 --> 51:59.340]  Nowadays, you have all those ultrasounds
[51:59.340 --> 51:59.740]  and everything.
[51:59.740 --> 52:00.060]  It seems...
[52:00.060 --> 52:01.420]  Yeah, but they can tell you.
[52:01.420 --> 52:02.700]  I feel like what happens often,
[52:02.700 --> 52:03.740]  and I bet some of our listeners
[52:03.740 --> 52:04.540]  have had this happen,
[52:04.540 --> 52:07.900]  is the nurse, the ultrasound nurse,
[52:07.900 --> 52:09.500]  not that they do it intentionally,
[52:45.200 --> 52:46.600]  The last name here was the Ring Bear.
[52:46.600 --> 52:47.600]  Yeah.
[52:47.600 --> 52:48.600]  Mark, hello.
[52:48.600 --> 52:49.600]  Good morning.
[52:49.600 --> 52:52.400]  Yeah, they weren't happy that Jackson and I said Cody Schrader was the St. Louis sports
[52:52.400 --> 52:53.400]  person of the year.
[52:53.400 --> 52:55.600]  They said it should have been Roman Berke.
[52:55.600 --> 52:59.200]  Well, I guess it kind of depends on what sport you're at.
[52:59.200 --> 53:04.200]  And the worst sports moment of the year was the doggies getting swept by sporting KC.
[53:04.200 --> 53:07.840]  I agree with the latter, but Cody Schrader was the sports person of the year.
[53:07.840 --> 53:08.840]  It's a slam dunk.
[53:08.840 --> 53:09.840]  It depends on if you...
[52:09.500 --> 52:11.900]  but just there can be an accident
[52:11.900 --> 52:13.740]  where they let it slip.
[52:13.740 --> 52:14.220]  Yeah.
[52:14.220 --> 52:15.100]  You know?
[52:15.100 --> 52:16.460]  Well, if they did, they didn't tell us.
[52:16.460 --> 52:16.700]  Right.
[52:16.700 --> 52:17.660]  It was a surprise to us.
[52:18.220 --> 52:19.180]  What do you want to know, though,
[52:19.180 --> 52:20.620]  only just to get the clothes
[52:20.620 --> 52:21.740]  and the baby stuff ready?
[52:21.740 --> 52:22.860]  Everything's beige right now.
[52:22.860 --> 52:24.460]  Yeah, the room is beige.
[52:24.460 --> 52:25.420]  Neutral, baby. Neutral.
[52:25.420 --> 52:25.900]  Neutral.
[52:27.020 --> 52:28.220]  I think you really don't need to know.
[52:29.100 --> 52:31.500]  Didn't have a cake exploding in blue and pink.
[52:31.500 --> 52:32.540]  It didn't do all that, no.
[52:34.380 --> 52:35.500]  Oh, that's a big thing now,
[52:35.500 --> 52:36.540]  these gender reveals.
[53:09.840 --> 53:14.600]  Cody does not have that season without what he did.
[53:14.600 --> 53:15.600]  Completely unexpected.
[53:15.600 --> 53:16.600]  In particular, November.
[53:16.600 --> 53:17.600]  There's a storm there.
[53:17.600 --> 53:18.600]  Absolutely.
[53:18.600 --> 53:19.600]  That's a slam dunk.
[53:19.600 --> 53:20.600]  And that's no slight against Berke.
[53:20.600 --> 53:21.600]  Right.
[53:21.600 --> 53:22.600]  It's no slight against anybody else.
[53:22.600 --> 53:27.600]  I think, and so it became like you guys hate soccer, you hate St. Louis, but it was, like
[53:27.600 --> 53:29.920]  I said, fine.
[53:29.920 --> 53:30.920]  But...
[53:30.920 --> 53:31.920]  Own it.
[53:31.920 --> 53:32.920]  Yeah, it's absolutely.
[53:32.920 --> 53:39.120]  But had, let's say, the dogs gotten to the third game in the best of three against sporting
[53:39.120 --> 53:46.920]  KC, and it's a one-one game an extra time in the 93rd minute, and Klaus scores a goal
[53:46.920 --> 53:51.840]  to send them to the next round, that's different than just like the opener.
[53:51.840 --> 53:54.160]  You know what I mean?
[53:54.160 --> 54:00.240]  And also, even though some don't view St. Louis in Colombia and Champaign being in the
[54:00.240 --> 54:06.660]  same ecosystem of sport, the purpose of the conversation, we always say it extends as
[52:36.540 --> 52:40.060]  You didn't do any of that.
[52:40.060 --> 52:41.260]  Gordon Hayward had a good one.
[52:42.620 --> 52:43.100]  That's right.
[52:43.100 --> 52:44.380]  He wasn't happy when he had, like,
[52:44.380 --> 52:45.420]  five straight daughters.
[52:45.420 --> 52:46.700]  Yeah, he had three daughters,
[52:46.700 --> 52:48.380]  and then they do the fourth one,
[52:48.380 --> 52:49.500]  and it pops out pink,
[52:49.500 --> 52:51.180]  and his face just falls down.
[52:51.980 --> 52:53.500]  He walked away crest forward.
[52:53.500 --> 52:55.100]  But I think his fifth child is a boy.
[52:55.980 --> 52:58.220]  Mazel Tov to John Vaughn and Gordon Hayward.
[52:58.220 --> 53:00.540]  Doug's patience is admirable.
[53:00.540 --> 53:02.540]  We honestly just got to sit for an hour
[53:02.540 --> 53:05.900]  listening to Ken's tales from his online drive sale
[54:06.660 --> 54:10.740]  far west as Colombia, as far east of Champaign.
[54:10.740 --> 54:14.100]  College football is more popular than MLS.
[54:14.100 --> 54:15.100]  Right.
[54:15.100 --> 54:17.020]  That's not set as a shot at MLS.
[54:17.020 --> 54:18.020]  I'm a soccer fan.
[54:18.020 --> 54:22.420]  I'm thrilled to see the success that they've had, but I also have an obligation to just
[54:22.420 --> 54:26.660]  call it how I see it, and it's not necessarily, as Jackson said, subjective.
[54:26.660 --> 54:27.940]  This is objective.
[54:27.940 --> 54:31.700]  College football is a hell of a lot more popular than the MLS at this moment.
[54:31.700 --> 54:34.500]  You couldn't watch the Meevas kick without coming right up out of your couch.
[53:05.900 --> 53:07.820]  before Doug finally got to reveal
[53:07.820 --> 53:09.820]  he had his first grandson.
[53:09.820 --> 53:11.020]  Congrats, Doug.
[53:11.020 --> 53:13.900]  Shut up, and get some little Tommy Trippin,
[53:13.900 --> 53:17.020]  so I think one texture of the year in 2022, I think.
[53:17.020 --> 53:17.900]  Maybe one rookie in here?
[53:17.900 --> 53:18.460]  He may have.
[53:18.460 --> 53:19.260]  He may have.
[53:19.260 --> 53:20.220]  He's had a heck of a career.
[53:20.220 --> 53:21.500]  I don't know why I voted for him.
[53:22.620 --> 53:25.580]  I'm sure I didn't keep Doug from revealing his grandchild.
[53:26.780 --> 53:27.900]  If I did, I apologize.
[53:29.340 --> 53:30.860]  Someone want to tell me how in the hell
[53:30.860 --> 53:32.780]  we got a topic of bumper stickers?
[53:33.420 --> 53:35.740]  That's from Aunt Peg, says Congrats, Doug.
[54:34.500 --> 54:36.540]  You couldn't, and I couldn't with my vertigo issues.
[54:36.540 --> 54:37.540]  No, that's right.
[54:37.540 --> 54:38.540]  You'd be careful.
[54:38.540 --> 54:43.060]  But most people, you couldn't watch that without screaming and cheering and jumping
[54:43.060 --> 54:44.060]  up and down.
[54:44.060 --> 54:47.460]  You know what was voted as the worst sports moment?
[54:47.460 --> 54:48.460]  Ruby fires.
[54:48.460 --> 54:49.460]  That's correct.
[54:49.460 --> 54:50.460]  A week ago today.
[54:50.460 --> 54:51.460]  That's right.
[54:51.460 --> 54:52.460]  Jeremy Rutherford joins us.
[54:52.460 --> 54:53.460]  Yeah, I do too.
[54:53.460 --> 54:54.460]  Jeremy Rutherford joins us right now.
[54:54.460 --> 54:56.860]  He's presented by this gentleman right now, Mark Hanna, Evergreen Wealth Strategies,
[53:35.740 --> 53:36.860]  If you'd have listened to the whole segment,
[53:36.860 --> 53:39.500]  you'd have known, because I called Doug's grandchild an it.
[53:41.820 --> 53:42.460]  It's okay.
[53:43.260 --> 53:44.380]  It's absolutely fine.
[53:46.060 --> 53:48.060]  I don't get real upset by things like that.
[53:49.020 --> 53:51.340]  Well, our textures do, though, for some reason.
[53:53.500 --> 53:54.380]  Not even your kids.
[53:54.380 --> 53:55.660]  Why are you getting upset about it?
[53:55.660 --> 53:58.540]  Some people just kind of live to be offended and upset,
[53:59.100 --> 54:00.620]  catch other people in saying something
[54:00.620 --> 54:04.140]  that they don't find completely 100% appropriate or too.
[54:56.860 --> 55:04.820]  online at evergreenstl.com, the number 314-889-0503.
[55:04.820 --> 55:05.820]  Morning, Jar.
[55:05.820 --> 55:06.820]  Morning, morning.
[55:06.820 --> 55:09.860]  I think Michael Anzus got jobbed on that best athlete.
[55:09.860 --> 55:10.860]  Wow, Doug.
[55:10.860 --> 55:12.140]  You like Bartachko.
[55:12.140 --> 55:13.140]  Number 20 seconds.
[55:13.140 --> 55:14.140]  Martin Hansus.
[55:14.140 --> 55:15.140]  Is he still playing?
[55:15.140 --> 55:16.140]  Michael.
[55:16.140 --> 55:17.140]  He's not still playing, Michael.
[55:17.140 --> 55:18.140]  He can't still be playing, is he?
[55:18.140 --> 55:19.140]  I sure hope not.
[55:19.140 --> 55:22.180]  Yeah, he'd be mid-40s, late 40s.
[55:22.180 --> 55:26.340]  I believe he played for something like 22 NHL teams.
[54:04.140 --> 54:07.580]  There is a business model in being a victim.
[54:08.780 --> 54:10.700]  I just don't care about anything.
[54:10.700 --> 54:14.780]  I feel like I just let everything just go over my shoulder.
[54:14.780 --> 54:16.700]  I just I don't get road rage.
[54:16.700 --> 54:19.580]  I just I don't people are crazy.
[54:19.580 --> 54:24.060]  So the more I can avoid any situation with any other human,
[54:24.060 --> 54:24.940]  I'm all for it.
[54:25.580 --> 54:26.860]  And that actually helps.
[54:26.860 --> 54:28.780]  Cuts down on the stress, anxiety.
[54:28.780 --> 54:31.980]  Hang out with you know who I'm cool and don't associate with
[55:26.780 --> 55:30.100]  He's the Edwin Jackson of the NHL.
[55:30.100 --> 55:33.260]  It was a Jim Dandy last night in Tampa.
[55:33.260 --> 55:38.820]  That's a word that I maybe should put in my computer and use for future reference.
[55:38.820 --> 55:39.820]  Jim Dandy.
[55:39.820 --> 55:40.820]  He should, you know.
[55:40.820 --> 55:41.820]  Wing dinger.
[55:41.820 --> 55:42.820]  Yeah, game like that.
[55:42.820 --> 55:44.020]  Sometimes that's all you put and move on.
[55:44.020 --> 55:45.820]  Yeah, Jim Dandy, we move on.
[55:45.820 --> 55:49.180]  You know, it's one of those where last night I had a lot of work to do.
[55:49.180 --> 55:51.940]  I have a couple of feature stories that I'm trying to crank out before Christmas.
[54:31.980 --> 54:34.300]  random people and you get out of those situations.
[54:34.940 --> 54:37.420]  I had a guy cut me off yesterday getting on to Bennington.
[54:37.420 --> 54:38.460]  He just pulled right in front of me.
[54:38.460 --> 54:39.420]  I just gave a little honk
[54:40.220 --> 54:42.460]  because I just wanted didn't remember to run into my car.
[54:43.260 --> 54:44.540]  So I slowed down, gave him a little honk,
[54:44.540 --> 54:46.700]  and he put his hand out the window, flipped me off.
[54:46.700 --> 54:47.820]  Oh, yeah, bro.
[54:47.820 --> 54:48.380]  One honk.
[54:48.380 --> 54:49.900]  I just kind of wave to him.
[54:49.900 --> 54:50.700]  I said, go ahead, buddy.
[54:51.500 --> 54:52.220]  What are you flipping me?
[54:52.220 --> 54:54.220]  You cut me off and you flip me off.
[54:54.860 --> 54:55.500]  I don't get it.
[54:55.500 --> 54:58.140]  There was a road rage murder in Fenton with last month.
[54:58.140 --> 54:58.620]  Is that right?
[54:58.620 --> 55:00.220]  Yeah, I've been a lot of them lately.
[55:00.220 --> 55:00.540]  Right there.
[55:51.940 --> 55:55.700]  And, you know, if you're going to watch the game, you got to pay attention to it every
[55:55.700 --> 55:56.700]  play.
[55:56.700 --> 56:00.300]  You know, if you're tweet following it, you got to be on top of it because if you make
[56:00.300 --> 56:01.300]  a mistake, people will jump.
[56:01.300 --> 56:05.300]  Well, I couldn't do that last night because those other assignments I'm working on.
[56:05.300 --> 56:09.180]  And once it got to about three, nothing, I felt pretty good about my decision not to
[56:09.180 --> 56:11.020]  follow that one.
[56:11.020 --> 56:12.020]  What's old is new again.
[56:12.020 --> 56:17.860]  They got the bounce after the new coach and then right back to where it was before.
[56:17.860 --> 56:21.760]  It's kind of a reminder to me that this was never about Barubie.
[55:00.540 --> 55:01.900]  Right there by the gravelway bluffs.
[55:02.620 --> 55:08.380]  Somebody, I guess, there was a minor rear end accident
[55:08.380 --> 55:13.020]  and the guy in the front walked back and started berating the guy in the second car.
[55:13.020 --> 55:15.260]  This guy in the second car was fumbling with his gun.
[55:15.260 --> 55:18.300]  And then when the guy in the first car was done walking back to his car,
[55:18.300 --> 55:20.540]  the guy in the second car shot him in the back and killed him.
[55:22.540 --> 55:23.180]  That's a lot of those.
[55:23.180 --> 55:24.620]  Right there on 141, I think.
[55:25.180 --> 55:26.620]  I just never have honked.
[55:26.620 --> 55:27.100]  Holy crap.
[55:27.100 --> 55:28.220]  I never needed to honk.
[55:28.220 --> 55:30.220]  Yeah, and don't ever get out of the car.
[56:21.760 --> 56:25.400]  This is strictly about the players and what they're about.
[56:25.400 --> 56:27.160]  Are you seeing something different from your angle?
[56:27.160 --> 56:28.160]  Yeah, Mark.
[56:28.160 --> 56:29.360]  No, I agree with you.
[56:29.360 --> 56:33.280]  And that's why I took the hard stance that I did when they made the coaching.
[56:33.280 --> 56:37.560]  Yeah, you did more of a roster issue than a coaching issue.
[56:37.560 --> 56:41.600]  And that's not to say that, you know, there weren't things that had grown stale with Craig
[56:41.600 --> 56:47.120]  Brube or, you know, not everybody was on board or some areas didn't need some improvement.
[56:47.120 --> 56:48.120]  Of course they did.
[56:48.120 --> 56:50.400]  But to me, it's a little bit of the chicken of the egg.
[55:30.380 --> 55:32.940]  Get an argument at a mall over a parking spot.
[55:32.940 --> 55:33.500]  Don't do it.
[55:33.500 --> 55:34.060]  That chasing him out of 100.
[55:34.060 --> 55:35.500]  Half the people would drive around with guns.
[55:36.700 --> 55:39.500]  I honked just to let him know I was there and he still got over.
[55:39.500 --> 55:41.340]  I had to slow down or he would have hit me.
[55:41.340 --> 55:43.580]  That's no reason I honked because a lot of people start to get over
[55:43.580 --> 55:46.860]  and they're not paying attention or they don't have a new car
[55:46.860 --> 55:48.620]  where it's got the yellow light that flashes.
[55:49.820 --> 55:51.100]  So there's a blind spot there.
[55:51.660 --> 55:52.220]  So you honked.
[55:52.220 --> 55:53.500]  Hey, you're going to hit me.
[55:54.220 --> 55:55.740]  So I did honk, but he kept going anyway.
[55:55.740 --> 55:58.300]  So I slowed down and then he flipped me off for honking at him.
[56:50.400 --> 56:54.400]  You know, what kind of roster do you have that Craig Barubie has to work with to produce
[56:54.400 --> 56:56.040]  the results that you're looking for?
[56:56.040 --> 57:00.720]  So, you know, it's been fun to watch the Blues play well under Drew Bannister for the first
[57:00.720 --> 57:01.720]  two games.
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.200]  And I think we've seen some improvement in some areas, but how much of it is getting
[57:05.200 --> 57:06.480]  that jolt from a new coach?
[57:06.480 --> 57:10.720]  So last night, I think we saw what we saw with the Craig Barubie teams.
[57:10.720 --> 57:12.800]  Is the Jordan-Kairu issue behind us now?
[57:12.800 --> 57:13.800]  Is that forgotten?
[57:13.800 --> 57:15.800]  Has everyone moved on from that?
[57:15.800 --> 57:17.480]  Yeah, I sure hope so.
[55:58.940 --> 56:01.500]  I probably saved you some damage in your car.
[56:03.180 --> 56:03.740]  Whatever.
[56:03.740 --> 56:09.100]  Well, there's not much to be gained by trying to get one more spot in front of a car on the highway
[56:09.100 --> 56:10.540]  or on an exit.
[56:10.540 --> 56:11.100]  I know.
[56:11.100 --> 56:12.220]  I'm trying to move scares.
[56:12.220 --> 56:15.580]  I mean, well, you're going to arrive two seconds later than you otherwise would have.
[56:15.580 --> 56:18.540]  And then you're going to get the stop sign anyway and wait like everybody else.
[56:18.540 --> 56:20.140]  They really don't make any sense.
[56:20.140 --> 56:22.620]  And if someone cuts in front of you on an exit,
[56:22.620 --> 56:25.020]  they drive up and they get around the line.
[56:25.020 --> 56:25.820]  Just let them go.
[56:26.780 --> 56:27.740]  Just let them go.
[57:17.560 --> 57:21.240]  I talked to Tim about that earlier this week on 101.
[57:21.240 --> 57:26.960]  And I think that as long as he plays well, gives an honest effort, you know, these fans
[57:26.960 --> 57:27.960]  are going to be behind them.
[57:27.960 --> 57:29.400]  They showed it the other night.
[57:29.400 --> 57:34.520]  And obviously after his emotional postgame little press conference, it seemed like they
[57:34.520 --> 57:35.920]  kind of took that to heart.
[57:35.920 --> 57:37.120]  Lots of signs the other night.
[57:37.120 --> 57:38.760]  We love Kairu.
[57:38.760 --> 57:42.880]  So I feel like he probably realized what he said was the wrong thing.
[56:27.740 --> 56:30.700]  It's frustrating, but just let them go.
[56:30.700 --> 56:31.100]  Who cares?
[56:31.100 --> 56:31.820]  Well, I don't let them go.
[56:31.820 --> 56:33.420]  I figured you would.
[56:33.420 --> 56:34.860]  I'm going to say.
[56:34.860 --> 56:36.060]  But I don't get mad about it.
[56:36.060 --> 56:39.180]  But I said, no, if you're going to, if you're not going to wait in line like the rest of us,
[56:39.180 --> 56:42.300]  and you want to try and go all the way up to the front and then try to barge in,
[56:42.300 --> 56:43.180]  I'm not going to let you go.
[56:43.180 --> 56:44.140]  You wait for everybody else.
[56:44.140 --> 56:44.460]  What do you do?
[56:44.460 --> 56:45.660]  You cut them off there?
[56:45.660 --> 56:46.620]  No, I just don't let them in.
[56:47.580 --> 56:52.140]  I could slow down and say go, but I don't because you're trying to buck the line.
[56:52.140 --> 56:54.780]  It's kind of like you're in a line for a concert and somebody butts in.
[56:54.780 --> 56:55.900]  You don't let them do that.
[56:55.900 --> 56:57.260]  No, get in the back like everybody else.
[57:42.880 --> 57:48.200]  And I feel like St. Louis took him to task on it, as St. Louis, you know, has done over
[57:48.200 --> 57:51.120]  the years in terms of keeping everybody honest.
[57:51.120 --> 57:56.240]  And then when he showed them how he felt otherwise and expanded on his comments and then played
[57:56.240 --> 57:59.400]  as well as he did the other night, he kind of changed the storyline.
[57:59.400 --> 58:02.920]  So that was a crazy 24-36 hours.
[58:02.920 --> 58:04.760]  Drew Bannister in a unique spot.
[58:04.760 --> 58:10.080]  He is an interim coach and as we've made reference to before, JR, we've seen the Oilers after
[58:10.080 --> 58:12.520]  their slow start get a bounce with the new coach.
[58:12.520 --> 58:14.040]  Went on a big streak.
[58:14.040 --> 58:17.120]  Same thing with Minnesota after firing Dean Evison.
[58:17.120 --> 58:20.080]  Blues certainly hoping to see if that tracks with Drew Bannister.
[58:20.080 --> 58:25.260]  And here he is in his third game and he benches Pavel Butch-Nevich for the final 13 minutes
[58:25.260 --> 58:31.440]  last night in what was certainly a rough one without a lot of pushback from the Blues against
[58:31.440 --> 58:32.440]  Tampa Bay.
[58:32.440 --> 58:35.280]  What do you think about him making that statement in his third game?
[58:35.280 --> 58:37.440]  Well, this is what he has to do.
[58:37.440 --> 58:40.640]  Like when the general manager comes out in his press conference and says the two things
[56:58.140 --> 57:01.420]  It's a little different if you're just in line at a concession stand or something.
[57:01.420 --> 57:06.380]  But on the road where people are driving so fast and your lives are at risk,
[57:06.380 --> 57:07.100]  just let them in.
[57:07.660 --> 57:08.140]  Let them in.
[57:08.140 --> 57:09.100]  Yeah, there's no one.
[57:09.100 --> 57:11.740]  You'll, trust me, you'll forget about it 10 seconds later.
[57:11.740 --> 57:13.100]  That's good counsel right there.
[57:13.100 --> 57:14.540]  It does give you good counsel.
[57:14.540 --> 57:16.860]  Yeah, well, I forgot about not letting them in too.
[57:16.860 --> 57:17.660]  Five seconds later.
[57:18.780 --> 57:22.780]  Well, you wouldn't forget about it though if you weren't into some raging azure who wants to,
[57:22.780 --> 57:25.260]  you know, scrap or pull a pistol on you.
[57:25.260 --> 57:27.260]  Well, I don't think that's...
[58:40.640 --> 58:45.120]  that I've told your bastard that I want to see Tim our accountability and compete.
[58:45.120 --> 58:48.880]  You know, if Drew Bannister wants any shot at this job, that's what Doug Armstrong is
[58:48.880 --> 58:50.440]  going to have to see.
[58:50.440 --> 58:54.240]  And to Drew Bannister's credit, I don't think he's coming in and this is some sort of fake
[58:54.240 --> 58:55.240]  thing.
[58:55.240 --> 58:56.240]  Okay, here's what the GM wants.
[58:56.240 --> 59:00.680]  This is something I talked to most of the 11 guys who played for him in Springfield
[59:00.680 --> 59:05.200]  played for him in the minors and they said that's number one with him is his accountability.
[59:05.200 --> 59:06.760]  So what do we see last night?
[59:06.760 --> 59:09.160]  Three hooking penalties by Pavel Butch-Nevich.
[57:27.260 --> 57:29.580]  Didn't you have somebody follow you into the Hubbard garage?
[57:29.580 --> 57:31.260]  Didn't you tell a story about that or was that something else?
[57:31.260 --> 57:31.900]  Yeah, he did.
[57:31.900 --> 57:33.100]  Yeah, but we're on the red light.
[57:34.140 --> 57:37.580]  He followed, so you ran the red light and he followed you to the Hubbard garage?
[57:37.580 --> 57:38.460]  You made that up.
[57:38.460 --> 57:39.980]  You're already dancing with the devil.
[57:39.980 --> 57:40.940]  I did not make it up.
[57:42.220 --> 57:42.620]  I think the light...
[57:42.620 --> 57:44.860]  So then what happened once you guys got into the Hubbard garage?
[57:44.860 --> 57:46.300]  I'm not even sure they followed me.
[57:46.300 --> 57:47.580]  It's just that I guess...
[57:47.580 --> 57:49.900]  Well, was there a vehicle that pulled up behind you?
[57:49.900 --> 57:50.540]  And...
[57:50.540 --> 57:51.900]  Well, when I was parking.
[57:51.900 --> 57:52.380]  Okay.
[57:52.380 --> 57:54.940]  They came up and said, you know, you ran that red light back there.
[57:54.940 --> 57:55.980]  I said, I run it every morning.
[59:09.160 --> 59:11.760]  And he finds the bench for the last 12 or 13 minutes.
[59:11.760 --> 59:16.360]  And gosh, if you're going to bench anybody that's going to catch everybody's attention,
[59:16.360 --> 59:20.280]  it certainly is Pavel Butch-Nevich who's one of the Blues best players and one of their
[59:20.280 --> 59:21.280]  hardest workers.
[59:21.280 --> 59:22.480]  So we'll see what comes of it.
[59:22.480 --> 59:25.280]  But I'm sure it had to be an eye opener in that locker room.
[59:25.280 --> 59:28.840]  Recalls Mike Keenan benching Dale Howardchuck in his home town.
[59:28.840 --> 59:29.840]  Dale Howardchuck.
[59:29.840 --> 59:33.720]  Well, Keenan would have done that just to be mean spirit.
[59:33.720 --> 59:36.280]  I think he cackled with laughter.
[59:36.280 --> 59:39.040]  Evil, devious nature.
[57:56.860 --> 57:58.380]  I said, did you run it?
[57:58.380 --> 57:58.700]  No.
[57:58.700 --> 57:59.980]  How did you get this close to me?
[58:00.940 --> 58:01.980]  How did you get here so quick?
[58:03.020 --> 58:04.860]  They just want to let me know I ran the red light.
[58:04.860 --> 58:05.980]  Like, I know I ran the red light.
[58:07.980 --> 58:08.460]  Oh.
[58:08.460 --> 58:08.940]  Huh.
[58:08.940 --> 58:10.700]  Like a citizens arrest he was making.
[58:10.700 --> 58:11.500]  I wasn't listening to you.
[58:11.500 --> 58:12.860]  It's like Cobra Pile.
[58:12.860 --> 58:14.060]  Citizens arrest!
[58:14.060 --> 58:15.020]  Citizens arrest!
[58:15.020 --> 58:16.860]  It's one of my favorite episodes of any kind of a citizens arrest episode.
[58:16.860 --> 58:17.500]  It's like a year ago.
[58:17.500 --> 58:17.980]  I don't know.
[58:21.260 --> 58:25.340]  I wonder how people would react if you attempted to make a citizens arrest these days.
[59:39.080 --> 59:41.240]  Mark, I think that goes one step further with Howardchuck.
[59:41.240 --> 59:45.520]  I think that Howardchuck's grandma was going to be in the crowd that night.
[59:45.520 --> 59:50.400]  I don't know, Tim, if you got the great memory and was going to see him play for the first
[59:50.400 --> 59:53.560]  time and then Keenan scratched him.
[59:53.560 --> 59:54.560]  Wow.
[59:54.560 --> 59:56.360]  Well, that would be just malicious.
[59:56.360 --> 59:57.360]  That's all that would be.
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.120]  It's a mean as a hearted Doug.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.760]  Keenan was just such a such a mean spirited guy.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.200]  He just really was for no real reason at all.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.320]  He'd had success in the league.
[58:25.820 --> 58:26.780]  They're running a red light.
[58:26.780 --> 58:27.660]  Oh, that would go for me.
[58:27.660 --> 58:28.300]  They'd better be ready to find it.
[58:28.300 --> 58:28.940]  Stay in your car.
[58:29.500 --> 58:30.620]  Calling the police on you.
[58:31.420 --> 58:32.300]  On what, a red light?
[58:35.260 --> 58:36.460]  Is that even a thing?
[58:36.460 --> 58:38.460]  Can you make a legal citizens arrest?
[58:39.260 --> 58:39.980]  I think you're...
[58:39.980 --> 58:41.100]  That's murky waters.
[58:41.100 --> 58:41.660]  Good luck.
[58:43.180 --> 58:45.980]  I mean, if you assault somebody while you're doing it, I don't think that's allowed.
[58:45.980 --> 58:48.060]  I guess if you see somebody assault somebody or they get into a fight,
[58:48.060 --> 58:49.820]  you can keep on the ground and call the cops.
[58:49.820 --> 58:52.380]  You might be in bigger trouble for impersonating an officer
[58:52.380 --> 58:54.140]  than for the guy who ran the red light.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.400]  A god in New York.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.720]  He had a good team here.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.760]  I don't know what happened to him.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.920]  Here we are still talking about him.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.600]  He's been gone for a quarter of a century.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.800]  Did he carry around a lot of hair wax?
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.800]  He definitely had that stuff.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.800]  A lot of grease.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.800]  A lot of grease.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.800]  No, I could have ended the Mike Keenan era and had a statue in St. Louis.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.000]  There was one time he was walking in front of my car and I could have just hit the gas
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  there and ended the thing.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  But I decided not to and what happened to happen?
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.200]  I think we're going to have a hell of an atmosphere on Saturday night right before Christmas.
[58:54.380 --> 58:57.420]  You're going to get sued for any damages you do to that person.
[58:57.420 --> 58:59.420]  So let's say you break his arm in the process.
[58:59.420 --> 59:00.300]  Well, there you go.
[59:00.300 --> 59:01.980]  You don't have to break his arm.
[59:01.980 --> 59:03.100]  Well, I'm strong.
[59:03.100 --> 59:03.980]  But that's...
[59:03.980 --> 59:05.420]  Obviously, I'm breaking an arm.
[59:05.420 --> 59:08.220]  That's serious stuff if you start impersonating a police officer.
[59:08.220 --> 59:08.860]  There are...
[59:08.860 --> 59:10.460]  Jackson, do you have the text inbox open?
[59:10.460 --> 59:11.260]  Indeed, indeed.
[59:11.260 --> 59:13.900]  So you see all the text coming in saying that this is not true.
[59:13.900 --> 59:14.940]  What's not true?
[59:14.940 --> 59:15.900]  I think they're talking about...
[59:15.900 --> 59:17.020]  Oh, I'm sure it's the parking lot.
[59:17.020 --> 59:20.700]  Being followed and then something else that didn't happen that I just made up.
[59:20.700 --> 59:21.180]  Oh, yeah.
[59:21.180 --> 59:22.620]  Anytime an Aggie story comes...
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.600]  Connor Bedard, Black Hawks, a little pony in town.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600]  What do you think?
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.200]  You think that building will be fired up?
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.520]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.400]  And Tim, you know, what am I a little bit older than you, I think.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400]  But you remember those days?
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.400]  Those are the best.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.400]  Oh my god.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.400]  Yeah, man.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.400]  They really were.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.400]  Black Hawks, games.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.400]  All the sorority sisters are back home from a zoo right now for those couple of weeks.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.400]  They're like, don't trip.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400]  Don't trip.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400]  The sundress is in December.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.400]  It was great.
[59:22.700 --> 59:24.700]  This story has changed so much since it happened.
[59:24.700 --> 59:27.500]  Such a weird thing to lie about that's from Glove Blogger.
[59:27.500 --> 59:28.300]  I don't know how it's changed.
[59:28.300 --> 59:29.260]  It was a year ago.
[59:29.260 --> 59:29.580]  Dammit.
[59:29.580 --> 59:30.460]  I'm going to have to call this audio.
[59:30.460 --> 59:31.900]  Things that never happened for $500, please.
[59:31.900 --> 59:33.420]  That's from Josh Bob Bill.
[59:33.420 --> 59:34.380]  And he went to the...
[59:35.260 --> 59:37.580]  He went to the Ning and the Blues last night.
[59:37.580 --> 59:39.180]  Jim Dandy went to overtime, didn't he?
[59:39.180 --> 59:39.660]  No.
[59:39.660 --> 59:40.220]  Good stuff.
[59:40.220 --> 59:41.820]  Man, he's a great game.
[59:41.820 --> 59:43.900]  Somebody came in the parking lot and said,
[59:43.900 --> 59:44.940]  you know you ran that red light.
[59:44.940 --> 59:45.820]  That's all I remember.
[59:45.820 --> 59:48.140]  Again, should we be saying, quote,
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.400]  It was great.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.880]  I don't obviously the rivalry is, I guess, still there, but nothing like I remember,
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880]  you know, 90s.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.880]  But it should be good.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.640]  Yeah, Bedard has introduced a whole new element to this rivalry and he's off to a phenomenal
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.640]  start.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.800]  So the last game before Christmas Saturday night should be a good crowd.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.040]  And Blue's trying to bounce back after they come home from Florida after tomorrow's game.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040]  There it is.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040]  Jeremy Rutherford.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040]  I know you're hard out.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.840]  Who knows what this guy's up to with his hard out, but you got to respect the hard out.
[59:48.140 --> 59:52.700]  my car when driving a Lee Sandor freeloading on Tim's Good Name?
[59:52.700 --> 59:55.020]  That's from Glove Blogger, Tom Trevin.
[59:57.660 --> 01:00:01.660]  Now, is it possible this person worked here and he was coming to the same place?
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.220]  What about that?
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.260]  Was that a co-worker?
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.220]  So he just arrived in the parking lot?
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.900]  Was it John Kiosky by chance?
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.020]  Was that awkward?
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.220]  I know people that work here.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.020]  Maybe they worked in the other building.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:11.180]  I don't know.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.380]  It's a sizable complex.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.700]  It could be somebody working next door office.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.820]  Maybe they're pulling in here anyway.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.280]  He's right.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.280]  Like the tickets.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.240]  Here in a few minutes can interview Dave Peacock for a story I've got coming up, but I did
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.840]  want to say before I jumped out here.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840]  Thanks guys.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:48.000]  That back in my post-Dispatch days, I covered one Maggie in her basketball career.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.800]  Did you really full circle?
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800]  Yeah.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.800]  Yeah.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:52.800]  Her and her sister adding current word.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.280]  And this was before she went on to the eight Hall of Fame.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.280]  That's correct.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.280]  It's up to eight now.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.280]  She just got another.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.080]  She was quite the star player.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.480]  Oh, really good.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.540]  I'm not sure that they followed me in there because I ran the red light.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.820]  Well, you should have used that as your story.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.300]  But they saw it.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.340]  It's been more believable.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.940]  Well, I'm just telling you what happened.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.420]  I don't know.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.380]  I think you're skeptical.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.820]  I remember what I said last time.
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.300]  It happened.
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.340]  It happened a year ago.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:28.860]  Just like you.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.540]  You'll forget about it in five minutes.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.260]  I forgot about it.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.220]  Yeah.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.140]  Still Tim brought it up or a text her brought it up.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.180]  How are lying about it?
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.460]  Ah, stories changed.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.260]  You'll forget about it.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.380]  Somebody found me in the next thing.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.180]  I think I did bring it up.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.940]  I just didn't think it was a lie.
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.700]  The audience, for whatever reason, really thinks it's a lie.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.060]  Everything I do is a lie to these people.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.120]  Yeah.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.120]  And at Carnot, they had quite the team.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.880]  Anytime the post-Dispatch said you're heading out to incarnate, it was a lot of fun.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.440]  It's like a factory out there.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.680]  So I don't know if they were moving girls around to move in the district or what, but
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.560]  they had a pretty good team.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.560]  Yeah.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.320]  Right across from where Cletus will urinate on the foliage.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.320]  Normally golf course.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.240]  Is that 16 or 17, Doug?
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.800]  I don't know the course numbers.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:25.800]  17.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.400]  And I guess it was a private school, so he can come from anywhere, but they have quite
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.400]  the talent.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.400]  She's one of the great people.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400]  Amen.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400]  Yeah.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.400]  A big fan.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.680]  Jay Hart, that's wonderful to hear from you as always.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.720]  I've appreciated your transparency on the Cairo thing, which I'm sure was a stressful
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:48.880]  series of days and always enjoy our conversations no matter whether it's on 101 or here on TMA.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.880]  Sir, thank you so much.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.920]  And season's greetings to you and yours.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.440]  Yep, you guys too.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.440]  Thanks Mark and the whole gang here.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.440]  Merry Christmas and we'll talk to you next week.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]  There it is.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440]  Thanks, Ruthie.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]  That's the great.
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:45.660]  Oh, look at that.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.020]  Look at this.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:47.900]  Look at that.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.020]  I'm saying you'll forget about a car cutting in front of you on the highway.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:55.500]  You won't forget about another motorist storming your car because you ran a light.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.420]  Black Dog's giving good counsel, Iggy.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.940]  Well, I run them every day.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:01.980]  Not bad.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.500]  The flipping people off stuff.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.460]  I don't flip anybody off.
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:04.700]  Oh, okay.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.500]  I thought you said you did.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.940]  I've already asked Jodi to pull the parking garage footage.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:11.180]  That's from KG in O-Town, so I guess we're going to get it.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:11.420]  Yeah.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.880]  Thanks for having us here.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.000]  Brought to you by this gentleman here, Mark Hannon.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.080]  He's got wonderful hair.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.000]  It seems like it's getting thicker by the day.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Really?
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  What do you do to it?
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  I got a shorn the other day.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  You got a shorn?
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  You can get a cut and still have this thick pompadour hair.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.760]  I got a haircut this morning too.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:26.160]  I so admire JR how he responded to, as a professional, to what happened after he tweeted.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]  He owned it.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.000]  I disagree that that's what caused it.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.940]  We better introduce yourself when you come in because I'm sure she doesn't know who you are.
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.420]  And she'll have all kinds of time to pull the footage.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.700]  Could you imagine, Jodi?
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.780]  I love Jodi to death, but I could not imagine.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:25.020]  I'm very eager to pull footage from a year ago.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.420]  If there was a triple homicide committed back there,
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.580]  you probably couldn't pull the footage a year later.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:31.740]  No.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.380]  Yeah, I lied about it.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.180]  Let's just forget about it.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.220]  Nobody pulled me in the garage.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.180]  I made it all up.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.300]  I'm going to go in today and say I got...
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.580]  Somebody came to me in the garage and said I ran a red light.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.180]  That'll be a good story for the morning.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:39.000]  I think that the real root cause of the vitriol against Khairu is everything that happened
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  up to it.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.800]  Barubie was our guy.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.120]  And here's Khairu.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.640]  He made these comments.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:51.840]  The comments were reflective of how he was approaching the situation.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.120]  It wasn't the comments that did it.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.620]  The comments reflected what was going on underneath.
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:58.400]  His lack of preparation, lack of maturity.
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.860]  I sit there and I do that every morning.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.260]  Oh.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:43.660]  Yes.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.180]  I think I'm just going to have to talk about it.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:45.260]  Yes.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:45.580]  Yes.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.820]  What lie can I tell today?
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.900]  I think getting pulled over in the garage, running a red light would be the thing to do.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:59.420]  Well, I'm assuming this gentleman also worked and parked in the same garage.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.340]  And just happened to get there a few seconds.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.260]  He waited for the light, and then he turned in.
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.980]  And then he happened to bark next to you.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:06.780]  Probably.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.300]  And said, hey, you know, you ran that light.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.020]  Probably.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.540]  Maybe he told me that and I don't remember.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.680]  Sure, he had great seasons.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.680]  He was putting up points.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.200]  But it's not enough to be when you're, what is it, an $8 million player.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.280]  It's not enough to be 95%.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.960]  You got to be 100%.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.840]  And people could see that in his play.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.320]  I love the fact that he responded better the last two games.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.280]  Maybe this is the whole point of this whole thing.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.120]  But Drew Bannister has got a real challenge.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.420]  Imagine following up a legendary coach.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.420]  That's where he is right now.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.420]  It's a big challenge.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.680]  So you think a lot of the fans were looking for someone to blame and Khairu was convenient.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.640]  I think the fans already knew.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.500]  I don't know.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.180]  It was a lie, so I can't remember all the lies.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.060]  Oh.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.100]  It starts with a G and ends with an ale vulva.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.380]  Ale vulva.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.500]  Oh my goodness.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.060]  Say, uh...
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.660]  Swoop will pull up the audio this time.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.660]  He'll one of these other idiots again.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.420]  Holiday shopping for you.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.700]  Go to mysoundstory.com, promo code TMA, and look.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.740]  You've just taken care of a gift that your family will love this year.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:39.500]  And for years to come, imagine being able to just go on your phone and listen to your
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.040]  I think the fans would have been booing.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040]  I agree with that part.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.440]  I don't think he gets booed like that without the quote.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.600]  Do you think he would have gotten booed like that without the quote?
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600]  I think he might have.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600]  Really?
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600]  Absolutely.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600]  I shall respectfully disagree.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.600]  Maybe I'm envious of your hair.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600]  I don't know.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600]  But I think that's...
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.360]  You let a lot of things go when a guy has a hair like this.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.360]  Right, that's the thing.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.360]  Yeah.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]  Yeah.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.360]  It's like politicians, you know.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.080]  It's tough to be a politician, bald politician when...
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.080]  Look at this, look at that.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.080]  Can we go...
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.080]  Look at this, look at that.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.080]  Isn't that the greatest drop in show history?
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:45.980]  grandparents' voice, your parents' voice, or now, as we offer with a three-camera video shoot,
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:49.820]  see their image any time you want, hear their stories any time you want,
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:54.300]  and know that your children and their children will always have your family's legacy saved.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.660]  It is a wonderful holiday gift, but it's a gift for your round.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.540]  And it is at mysoundstory.com, an hour-long interview, conducted either here at the
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:07.820]  Hubbard Radio Studios or over Zoom, or we can actually go to your home as well,

[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.220]  Doug, tell the people about Nautrals.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.980]  Well, Nautrals is a great gift idea.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.580]  Only a few days here left before the holidays, but it doesn't have to be a Christmas present
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.140]  to your dog.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.100]  You could buy it any time.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.380]  They like them year-round.
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.940]  But it's a nice little stocking stuffer for your dog.
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:35.420]  Talking about Nautrals, of course, a locally-owned family business founded by two dedicated
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.520]  God, I love that drop.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.840]  Let's do a one-time award for that greatest drop in show history.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:03.840]  I mean, I'm telling you.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.840]  Yeah, we find it here.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.840]  All right, just find it, Flosie.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.840]  Oh, look at that.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.840]  Look at this, look at that.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840]  You like that one, don't you, Mark?
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.840]  God, I can't give it up.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.480]  Oh, can you send that to my phone?
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.480]  That's going to be my new rictone.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.480]  Send me your...
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.480]  As long as I have your email, I'll send it.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.480]  Any time you get a call, new client on the line and he...
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.480]  Look at that, look at that.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.560]  I sent it to a listener yesterday and he's using it as his rictone.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.560]  It is wonderful.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]  God, it's so good.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:34.600]  314-889-0503, make that phone ring and then you will hear that from Mark Hanna's phone,
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.840]  Mark Hanna, Evergreen Wealth Strategies.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.720]  Merry Christmas to you and yours, fine sir.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.120]  Great to see you as always.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.960]  Have a festive winter holiday.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.960]  Thank you.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960]  Thank you, guys.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960]  Look at this, look at that.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]  Thanks, guys.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:51.380]  There he is, the great Mark Hanna of Evergreen Wealth Strategies here with presenting sponsor
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.260]  team A-listers who want to provide your dog with top-quality dog treats, like the one
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.140]  I'm holding up now.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.580]  I don't know if you can see that on YouTube.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:42.940]  Wonderful little treat for your dog.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:43.420]  No, not enough treat.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.420]  I'm telling you, Dora just loves these.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.780]  Nautrals carries a lineup of limited-ingredient dental chews,
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.980]  100% free rawhide-free options, and mouth-watering oven-baked cookies.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:54.780]  Keep your hands off.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.300]  These are exclusively for the dogs we don't recommend for human, because I suppose you
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.260]  could eat it if you want.
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:00.380]  Give it to the dog.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:05.100]  Your pup's tail will be wagging with excitement after tasting flavors like real peanut butter,
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:58.100]  of Jeremy Rutherford every Wednesday on TMA coming up in, oh Doug, I would say 19, 20
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.100]  minutes.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.100]  Hell, I don't know.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.100]  No, I don't know either.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:04.020]  Design Air Heating and Cooling Email of the Day, Seth Goldkamp, sponsor of Design Air
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.540]  Heating and Cooling's Email of the Day.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.540]  Doug is a client.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.540]  I am a client.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.540]  Say, friends, why don't you become a client?
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.620]  They came out to Iggy's place to save the day there as well.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.620]  It's Design Air.
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.500]  You run into a problem with your furnace.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.060]  Design Air Heating and Cooling says this.
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.860]  You can email me and it's fine.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.380]  chicken, and pumpkin.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:10.620]  Your dog will be begging for more, just like Dora does, and her cousin, Elway, who also
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:10.940]  loves them.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.740]  Discounted variety packs are also available for your pup.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.140]  You can enjoy all the flavors delivered right to your door.

[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.780]  I'm going to go ahead and spell Nautrals.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.740]  Do it.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.300]  G-N-A-W-T-U-R-A-L-S dot com.

[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.660]  Shop local this holiday season and gift your dog treats from Nautrals.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:49.980]  Another way to shop local is going to Glen Bats Jewelers on Manchester, in about a mile
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:53.820]  east of I-270, and Manchester exit.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.500]  You can park right behind the building.
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.740]  It is on the south side of Manchester.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:58.460]  Plenty of parking.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.820]  Some clients are like, yeah, that helps.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.980]  I appreciate it.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:25.140]  With Design Air, Seth's like, listen, here's the deal.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:30.500]  If it's urgent, emailing is not going to get it done quicker than going to designairservice.com
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:34.580]  because there's 24-hour service there and they're going to have somebody out there quick,
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:39.060]  fast in a hurry, whereas if he's sleeping in the middle at night, he can see.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.260]  So go to designairservice.com.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.260]  That's where you go.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.260]  Click on the book now tab and you're like, oh, maybe they're going to upsell me.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.140]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.700]  Then you go in and you see Craig and David Betts.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:05.500]  And oh, what a wonderful holiday gift you would get for a loved one at Glen Bats Jewelers.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.260]  And they get to know you.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.980]  Your likes, your lifestyle, the things you love.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.020]  The three L's, Doug.

[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.120]  They all built Design Air Heating and Cooling.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:56.580]  He carries on that legacy and the last thing he's going to do is besmirch it.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:57.580]  You like that term, besmirch it?
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.580]  I don't mind it, yeah.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.580]  It's kind of nice.
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.580]  I started to upsell.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.580]  It's not going to happen.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.140]  It's Design Air Heating and Cooling.

[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.260]  Jackson, what was yesterday's so-called?
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.260]  Jackson!
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.260]  Oh, my bad.

[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:28.380]  A local St. Louis jeweler starting in 1941.
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.900]  I know a number of our listeners have gone in there and gotten to know Craig and David
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:32.940]  and the staff.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.940]  And they rave about the experience.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.620]  Really quality people and a great holiday gift.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:45.180]  If you are looking to get your loved one jewelry, go to Glen Betts Jewelers.

[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.380]  Jackson!
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.380]  I thought we were one of Brandon.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:19.380]  No, you got it.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.380]  I got it.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.380]  Can I say the title?
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.380]  I don't know.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.380]  What's the FCC's rules?
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.380]  I don't remember what that's.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.380]  It's something with a hand job, didn't it?
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.460]  Yeah, Katie Cott kind of bastardized the rules on her last call.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:29.460]  She made it wrong.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:33.300]  So the title is a pro hand job podcast.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.300]  Oh.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:35.300]  Yep.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.380]  And so I'm going to take a stance at the end of the year.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:41.060]  Is it possible somebody had a problem with his hand and a doctor did some work on it
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.420]  and a doctor did the hand job?
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.220]  Well, I had a grammatical quandary.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.220]  As well.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.740]  Glen Betts Jewelers.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:59.900]  It is the Mungenass St. Louis Acure, Mungenass Burghardt, Alton, Toyota.
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.100]  Seven o'clock hour.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.060]  Even though it's 8.13, Jeremy Rutherford going to join us at nine o'clock.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.900]  He is presented to you by Mark Hanna.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.380]  And then we have the design, air, heating, and cooling email the day.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.780]  The morning after at inside stl.com.
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.260]  Also my final balloon party of 2023.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:20.140]  Jackson will be on tomorrow with Josh Innes, who does afternoons on K-Sheet,
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:50.420]  No quagmire because I hyphenated pro and hand job, which I think is correct.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.420]  Oh, is that right?
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.380]  I'm saying we are pro like we are for hand jobs.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:57.260]  I didn't want us to come off as we are professionals at giving them.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.260]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.260]  True.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.260]  The grammar can be the key, man.
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:04.140]  Who needs to get the education for that?
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:08.460]  So I consulted with Good Morning Gran on that one.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.460]  Good Morning Gran.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.460]  Yeah, and he went to Hofstra.
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:11.460]  So, you know, I...
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.460]  Is Hofstra known for its grammar?
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:13.460]  Oh, it's a good school.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:14.460]  Yeah, it's a good school.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.420]  0.5 tomorrow and Friday.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:29.260]  So Jackson, what do you have prepared for the final balloon party presentation,
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.420]  including me for 2023?
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.780]  Doug, I can't even imagine the guests who will be dropping by.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.260]  Oh, of Joel Quinville and Brett Hall.
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.260]  Really? To discuss the incident?
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.020]  Yeah, Mike Keenan maybe.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.020]  He loves doing interviews.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.580]  Yeah, so that's the plan for today.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.140]  You can't get Drew Bannister because apparently he hasn't spoken.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.700]  So I yield it to him.
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.700]  What's that again?
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.700]  I think Balzer went there.
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.700]  Hofstra.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.700]  That's a nice little tip.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.700]  I kicked out of there once.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.700]  I kicked out of Hofstra?
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.460]  We were there covering the Dolphins and the Jets.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.780]  We were about to play a playoff game.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:34.060]  So they sent us up there to cover a Jets practice back when the local media had some money to
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.060]  spend.
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:39.700]  And we tried to shoot a little bit of practice and the police came from all over everywhere.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:40.700]  Oh, no way.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.620]  So, you know, they were not happy with that.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.900]  No, he's probably scolding another player.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.900]  Oh, you got to do that a little as a coach, right?
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.580]  Yeah, worked out great for Mar-Mall.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.180]  What did he go, 25 games out of 500?
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:06:59.740]  Oh.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:00.620]  I think it was 20.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.620]  Speaking of which, I got this AJ Przyński sound.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500]  I will save it for the other side of the break, though.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.620]  Okay, all right, that's fair.
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.300]  He's in the news.
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.300]  Former Cardinal, he does this podcast, has a big following.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.100]  Doug, it's called foul territory.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.140]  Does it every day.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:19.660]  What's he on MLB Network for a while?
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.340]  Well, he's been calling playoff games.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:24.140]  He was Wainwright's broadcast partner during the playoffs.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:30.700]  And his thoughts on the Cardinals in the off season, you'll hear that coming up on the other side
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:31.020]  of the break.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.180]  Send your emails in for the design, air, heating and cooling email that day,
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.860]  the morning after at insidestl.com.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.020]  Buck Swope with a one goal lead over the JV golf coach.
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.780]  This is TMA presented by Brown and Crouppen from the Michelobolter studios.

[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.900]  Guys were doing things like stretching and jogging and you can't possibly have anybody
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.900]  shoot that.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:50.300]  It'll give away the game plan.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.300]  Fazar.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.780]  That's what I remember about Hofstra.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:56.980]  When Rob Fisher asked Mike Martz about Trump candidate Marshall Faulk being in the backfield
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:57.980]  together during practice.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:58.980]  I think that was Greg Marisak.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.980]  I think it was John Marisak.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.580]  No, it was Rob Fisher all the way.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.580]  Wasn't it?
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.300]  Jack Snow gave him the nickname Dr. Football after that.
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:06.300]  Well, that's right.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.740]  Marisak said something about Kurt Warner's wife on the air and she called him.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:11.740]  That's it.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:12.740]  That's what that was.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:17.500]  When I was listening live that day, they were talking about, God, I can't recall what
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.780]  it was about Kurt sitting out or something like that.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:26.460]  And Brenda called in when John was filling in for Frank Cusimato and Burwell was his
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:32.820]  co-host and Brenda called in just like air out Mike Martz and what really happened on
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:33.820]  the air.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:37.740]  I remember driving along listening to that going, Oh my God, I'm listening to the national
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.940]  lead story of SportsCenter.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:39.940]  Yeah, it became that.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.860]  One KFNS like 20 minutes after I'd gotten off the air.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:43.860]  It was unbelievable.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.860]  Yeah.
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:50.060]  I mean, the beginning of the end was Adam Vina Terry's kick, but the things that led
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.380]  to the eventual land, holy crap.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.380]  30 for 30 waiting to happen.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.380]  All right, we got a break and close out the end of the clock.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.660]  Oh, we got a friend of the feather calling in.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.660]  Somebody wants to call in, yeah.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.660]  Who we got?
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.660]  She just wants to call in and say hi.
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:02.660]  I'll be darned.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.660]  Maris is the type of show.
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:04.660]  I don't get to be.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.660]  No, it's a girl.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.660]  636.
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.660]  9-0-1.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.380]  9-0-0.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.900]  Oh, wait, we did 636?
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.900]  4TMA.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:13.900]  4TMA.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:14.900]  636 or not?
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.900]  It is.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.900]  636.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.900]  Almost wrapping up our second year.
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:19.900]  9-0-0.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:20.900]  4TMA.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.900]  That's right.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.900]  You used to be Cubs talk.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.900]  It was Cubs talk.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.900]  I think I know segments.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.900]  It's still, I still said it's Cubs talk.
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.900]  I designed air heating and cooling email.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.900]  And another lady calling in.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.900]  It just keeps siding.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.900]  And then Jackson and I just got to be like, Oh, I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:30.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:32.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:35.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:40.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:41.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:43.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:47.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:48.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:49.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:50.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:51.900]  I'm not going to be able to talk.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.900]  But you're going to be on tomorrow with Josh Innes.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.900]  Yeah, but like the standard iteration of Balloon Party.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.900]  It's our swan song.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.900]  You're going to have a different show within us or same stuff?
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.900]  I have no idea, honestly.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.900]  Like Thursday Thoroughfare?
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.900]  I'm just really the button jockey in that situation.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:08.900]  I think that's correct.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.900]  No, don't say button jockey.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.900]  That's basically all I'm doing.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.900]  Is someone calling?
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.900]  All right, I think someone's calling that.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.900]  Are you bringing the code kit?
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.900]  Yes.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.900]  Well, we're going to take a break right now.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.900]  We're going to take a break.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.900]  Okay.
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.900]  Who is this person?
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.900]  She'll tell you.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.900]  Is it Gaga?
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.900]  Yeah, Ela Verde broke again.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.900]  What?
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.900]  Ela Verde's not working out.
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:38.900]  Yeah, Jodi said that she had been in a like a, she had been in a killing surgery, right?
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.900]  Yeah, she just got rid of the-
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.900]  Cart, and now she had to come up the stairs because of the-
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.900]  Yeah, that's terrible.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.900]  It's the monthly breakdown.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:47.900]  Well, you know what happens.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.900]  That's why I never use it.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.900]  I don't want to be in the monthly breakdown when it breaks down in a minute.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.900]  It's also like 12 stairs.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.900]  It is.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.900]  Well, it creates all steps.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:57.900]  More if you're down in the lower level.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:58.900]  Yeah.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:11:59.900]  Oh, we got a break, Doug.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.900]  We have to.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.900]  We got a big phone call coming up, and we have this design, air heating, and cooling
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900]  email of the day.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.900]  This is TMA presented to you by Brown and Crouppen from the Micheloboltra Studios.

[00:00.000 --> 00:02.160]  The choice of a lawyer is important and shouldn't be based on an ad.
[00:02.160 --> 00:08.160]  After a serious car accident, people have two questions. Why me and what now?

[00:14.480 --> 00:21.040]  with the what now. Car repairs, medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering. We're Brown and

[00:29.040 --> 00:29.540]  App.
[00:30.080 --> 00:32.080]  I spent four years in San Francisco.
[00:32.800 --> 00:34.480]  The Brown and Crouppen boarding after.
[00:34.480 --> 00:36.480]  KPNTFM, HD2.
[00:36.480 --> 00:38.480]  Collinsville, St. Louis.
[00:51.040 --> 00:56.160]  We let people know. We let them know in advance though. They knew.
[00:51.040 --> 01:01.040]  The night is calm and I'm so alone I gave my soul just to call you my own
[01:01.040 --> 01:07.040]  God, I'm one above me God, no one to love me
[01:07.040 --> 01:11.040]  No, the man I wear can you be?
[01:11.040 --> 01:20.040]  I've heard it said that the thrill of romance can be like a heavenly dream
[01:20.040 --> 01:26.040]  I go to bed with a prayer that your son may gloat to me
[01:26.040 --> 01:30.040]  Strange as it seems
[01:30.040 --> 01:35.040]  Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all of my tears
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.040]  And whisper sweet little things in my knees
[01:40.040 --> 01:42.040]  A hug and a kiss then
[00:59.040 --> 01:01.040]  I like this one.
[01:01.040 --> 01:03.040]  I like this one.
[01:03.040 --> 01:05.040]  It's a little bit more of a holiday season.
[01:05.040 --> 01:07.040]  This one is pretty.
[01:07.040 --> 01:09.040]  Definitely sounds like something.
[01:09.040 --> 01:11.040]  It's an odd direction.
[01:11.040 --> 01:13.040]  A little bit of a holiday location.
[01:13.040 --> 01:15.040]  This is the more of a music business.
[01:15.040 --> 01:17.040]  No. I never said it was more of a level.
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.200]  Well, I think it's a little different today because the guy who's ran point for almost 20 years, Doug,
[01:25.200 --> 01:31.280]  20 years next year, is not in today. That's why I was stunned to not hear him when you when you
[01:31.280 --> 01:36.560]  opened the show. So the guy who kind of drives the bus, takes us in a break, takes us into live reads,
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.600]  moves across conversation points, is not in today. So yeah, the show is going to sound a touch
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.000]  different. I guess I could have looked around the studio and seen that he wasn't here. I was just
[01:30.040 --> 01:32.040]  What in this world were you just talking about?
[01:36.040 --> 01:38.040]  Who sings this little ditty up?
[01:38.040 --> 01:40.040]  Ah, my little brother.
[01:40.040 --> 01:42.040]  I'm sorry.
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.040]  I'm a little bit of a man, right?
[01:44.040 --> 01:46.040]  That's what all the girls do.
[01:46.040 --> 01:48.040]  They're in their haydings.
[01:48.040 --> 01:50.040]  Pretty decent.
[01:42.040 --> 01:45.040]  Oh, I'll have love in my still
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.040]  No, my man, I'll wear can you be?
[01:50.040 --> 02:00.040]  Welcome back to the morning after. I'm Axiom Jackson. Seated to my right, Douglas Elvin Vaughn, new grandfather. Congratulations.
[02:00.040 --> 02:10.040]  The entire Vaughn family, John Vaughn and his lovely wife. It's awesome to hear. The plow hawk is sitting across from me. Fingers plow hawk, Doug, when he gets those anything fingers out.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.640]  maybe not be so surprised. I was just going to say it is weird that you're surprised because
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.960]  you're not on remote. You're here in studio. You obviously see the cast of characters that are in
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.840]  the studio. I should look around I guess and socialize more. Tunnel locked in on those notes.
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.160]  And then Tim and I are on vacation next week and then because Tim and I are on vacation, you guys
[02:04.160 --> 02:09.600]  all get the week off too. Now it seems like there's something behind that. I don't think that's
[02:09.600 --> 02:13.920]  necessarily the case. I'm curious about how. Did you take a vacation next week? We were given it.
[02:00.040 --> 02:07.040]  I guess that I was meant to be alone.
[02:07.040 --> 02:09.040]  If we did it, you'd have to say, ooh,
[02:09.040 --> 02:10.040]  where do I pick me?
[02:10.040 --> 02:11.040]  Yeah, for real.
[02:11.040 --> 02:12.040]  Welcome back.
[02:12.040 --> 02:13.040]  Morning after.
[02:13.040 --> 02:15.040]  It was ended to you by Brown and Crouppen.
[02:17.040 --> 02:19.040]  We're broadcasting live from the McLobe Ultra Studios.
[02:19.040 --> 02:21.040]  There's 2.6 grams of carbs in the McLobe Ultra
[02:21.040 --> 02:23.040]  and 95 calories.
[02:23.040 --> 02:25.040]  On this extended break, I can imagine myself
[02:25.040 --> 02:27.040]  having plenty of McLobe Ultra.
[02:10.040 --> 02:13.040]  Right. Gosh, he can play the soundboard.
[02:13.040 --> 02:21.040]  In my stead, in my booth, KG in O-Town, who's kind enough to come on in and help us out today. We always appreciate it.
[02:21.040 --> 02:27.040]  And Ken Stroth is not here, but he's dealing with Hubbard Financials, getting some budgets ready to go for 2024.
[02:27.040 --> 02:28.040]  I think he's trying to get me on full time.
[02:28.040 --> 02:33.040]  Yep, yep, yep. Ironing out some vacation details, this, that and the other thing. But he'll be here shortly.
[02:33.040 --> 02:39.040]  Plow Hawk, I sent you something. I forged you an email. I'm going to tell you now, I'm not expecting the audio at this very moment.
[02:14.560 --> 02:20.320]  But you didn't take your vacation? No, no. You basically get an extra week off. Right. Okay,
[02:20.320 --> 02:25.520]  that's all the same. Well, we're smart because we got it off last year too. So we figure well,
[02:25.520 --> 02:32.320]  maybe we'll get it off this year again. I'm sorry. Lost a week vacation. No, no. Yeah, I took my
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.280]  vacation, but I should have just not taken my vacation, maybe taken a week in July and then
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.840]  had this week off too. But you wouldn't have been. Well, yeah, but that's hindsight because you can't
[02:27.040 --> 02:28.040]  Really?
[02:28.040 --> 02:30.040]  You stock some at home in the fridge?
[02:30.040 --> 02:31.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.040]  Just in case.
[02:32.040 --> 02:34.040]  You know, you pop one, you have a long day.
[02:34.040 --> 02:35.040]  Nothing like a cold one.
[02:35.040 --> 02:36.040]  End of a long day.
[02:36.040 --> 02:38.040]  Or you're gathered around the hearth with your family.
[02:38.040 --> 02:41.040]  You have a hearth in your new place there in Sue Larn.
[02:41.040 --> 02:42.040]  No.
[02:42.040 --> 02:44.040]  I have a radiator.
[02:44.040 --> 02:45.040]  Could you gather around a radiator?
[02:45.040 --> 02:47.040]  Could you build a hearth around that?
[02:47.040 --> 02:49.040]  I have like a wood plank on top of it.
[02:49.040 --> 02:50.040]  Hearth.
[02:50.040 --> 02:51.040]  It's kind of a hearth.
[02:51.040 --> 02:53.040]  So when the family's over, you say,
[02:53.040 --> 02:55.040]  hey, let's all gather around the radiator.
[02:55.040 --> 02:56.040]  My one-bedroom apartment.
[02:39.040 --> 02:54.040]  But I completely forgot we were talking about something in the break that reminded me that Chris Rabe yesterday sent me an audio postcard, a new audio postcard that has to deal with when Plowboy dropped 25 points on Sean Livingston.
[02:54.040 --> 02:55.040]  I think, let me.
[02:55.040 --> 03:04.040]  So I want to play that, but I just forded it to you, which is not the most optimal way of doing audio. I completely forgot about it this morning. So that's on me.
[03:04.040 --> 03:05.040]  I have it on the.
[03:05.040 --> 03:06.040]  So plenty of time. You don't need to do it.
[03:06.040 --> 03:08.040]  The Windows media player looks like it's ready to go.
[02:41.840 --> 02:47.040]  cash them in. I already understand if you were able to cash yours in, then that different. You
[02:47.040 --> 02:53.040]  can cash some of it. I think you can cash 60% of it in something like that. All right. So why don't
[02:53.040 --> 02:58.480]  you do that? No, I'm fine. I took my two weeks. That's great. This is my second week.
[03:00.880 --> 03:06.960]  But everybody got it off. So right. I've taken off two days this year. I know. You have to take
[03:09.040 --> 03:20.040]  In the meantime, so that you can get that fully set up, Doug and I will tell you about our beautiful hair. I'm of course wearing a little TMA beanie right now because I woke up that bad hair day.
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.040]  I'm a night shower. I'm a guy who takes a night shower.
[03:23.040 --> 03:24.040]  Why do you do that?
[03:24.040 --> 03:31.040]  I don't like to get into bed dirty. I like to get into bed so fresh and so clean. I do like a morning shower because it wakes you up.
[03:06.960 --> 03:11.680]  it off. I remember though, I was kidding because you haven't taken anything. Doug's the world
[03:11.680 --> 03:17.280]  traveler. He's been on a cruise. The vacation is starting. I had two weeks. You were able to buy a
[03:17.280 --> 03:22.960]  place in Monaco. That's how long you're gone. You're able to settle in, get the furniture moved in.
[03:22.960 --> 03:26.960]  That's right. I'm just kidding. Everybody should take as much as they can. And I think I've taken
[03:26.960 --> 03:31.280]  off three days, two days for that trip to Tennessee with my boys, Doug. Well, why didn't you take
[03:31.280 --> 03:36.000]  more? The dirty dozen, as you like to call us. Yeah, that was an odd trip. Or Jackson. It's better,
[02:56.040 --> 02:57.040]  And the entire family comes over?
[02:57.040 --> 02:58.040]  I saw it.
[02:58.040 --> 02:59.040]  There's room for a hearth.
[02:59.040 --> 03:00.040]  KG had to use the bath.
[03:00.040 --> 03:01.040]  So KG drove me to the year-end awards
[03:01.040 --> 03:03.040]  because I was looking to get liquored up.
[03:03.040 --> 03:04.040]  Mm-hmm.
[03:04.040 --> 03:05.040]  Which is very kind of him.
[03:05.040 --> 03:06.040]  Thank you, KG.
[03:06.040 --> 03:09.040]  And so he had to use the bathroom beforehand.
[03:09.040 --> 03:10.040]  So he got to come up to my place.
[03:10.040 --> 03:11.040]  It was really darling.
[03:11.040 --> 03:12.040]  Yeah, it was wonderful.
[03:12.040 --> 03:13.040]  It was a darling moment?
[03:13.040 --> 03:14.040]  It was a darling moment.
[03:14.040 --> 03:16.040]  I've picked up wild hawk from his place before and drove him.
[03:16.040 --> 03:18.040]  You could smell the sex in there.
[03:18.040 --> 03:19.040]  Oh, yeah.
[03:19.040 --> 03:22.040]  So when you have radiator heat, is it hot to the touch?
[03:22.040 --> 03:24.040]  Can you burn yourself if you brush up against it?
[03:31.040 --> 03:41.040]  Yeah, but this morning I just I showered last night before bed and I woke up a little later today and so I was like, sometimes I'll like just like run water over my head.
[03:41.040 --> 03:48.040]  So my hair looks good, but I was like, yeah, I'm just gonna toss a beanie on today. So but if you could see my hair, you would know that it is making.
[03:48.040 --> 03:53.040]  Can we see a little bit see what the year 90 has done to it? No, it's gonna look so bad. I don't want to do that. Just a little peak.
[03:54.040 --> 03:56.040]  That's not it. Wow. Whispy.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.760]  probably left unsaid. Where the boys are. The workload Jackson has, obviously the work ethic.
[03:42.480 --> 03:47.280]  It's hard to take a long time off. You feel responsible for what you leave behind,
[03:47.280 --> 03:50.160]  even though you shouldn't. I understand that probably how he feels.
[03:51.040 --> 03:57.280]  No, it's not like some sort of like Herculean effort. I'd just sooner just be in than not.
[03:58.640 --> 04:04.000]  But people do what they want. God bless. Take vacation. Don't take vacation. Whatever suits you.
[03:24.040 --> 03:25.040]  Burr.
[03:25.040 --> 03:28.040]  Like, if you kept your hand on it for, like, a long time,
[03:28.040 --> 03:29.040]  you'd probably get some damage.
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.040]  But it's not like if you touch it, it's going to sear your skin.
[03:33.040 --> 03:34.040]  No.
[03:34.040 --> 03:35.040]  It's hot, though.
[03:35.040 --> 03:36.040]  Is it?
[03:36.040 --> 03:37.040]  Yeah, so hot.
[03:37.040 --> 03:38.040]  And does it do a good job warming the place?
[03:38.040 --> 03:39.040]  It does the job.
[03:39.040 --> 03:40.040]  It does the job.
[03:40.040 --> 03:41.040]  Yeah, it's fine.
[03:41.040 --> 03:42.040]  How about air-co?
[03:42.040 --> 03:43.040]  Window air conditioning?
[03:43.040 --> 03:44.040]  Window units, yeah.
[03:44.040 --> 03:45.040]  Yeah.
[03:45.040 --> 03:47.040]  The great Seth Goldkamp hooked me up with a great window unit.
[03:47.040 --> 03:49.040]  Shout out to Seth Goldkamp for real design there.
[03:49.040 --> 03:50.040]  Heating and cooling.
[03:50.040 --> 03:53.040]  They are the sponsor of the email of the day.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.080]  But yeah, we'll be off next week. Obviously Monday is Christmas. Merry Christmas to all
[04:10.080 --> 04:14.400]  and to all good night. And then we'll be off Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.280]  back on the second because Monday the first is of course New Year's day. We're going to watch
[04:19.280 --> 04:25.360]  Alabama take on Michigan and Texas take on Washington. This is the morning after presented
[04:25.360 --> 04:29.680]  to you by Brian Crouppen live from the Michelob ultra studios. And this is the Mungenest seven
[03:57.040 --> 04:04.040]  We've got lots of gold in here. A tough town. We have lots of gold. Put that on the old hat real quick. But yeah, it's stainless hair restoration.
[04:04.040 --> 04:10.040]  They have hooked Doug and I up in a major, major way and they can help you out in a major way as well.
[04:10.040 --> 04:16.040]  I went in there. They said, you know what? This is kind of a 25 year old with really light colored hair. This is the kind of hair loss that they'll experience.
[04:16.040 --> 04:24.040]  We've had the best treatment for naster ride super easy. It's just a generic form of Pro-P. You can get it pretty much anywhere.
[04:29.680 --> 04:34.560]  o'clock hour to my right. This very handsome gentleman who is now a grandfather. That's Douglas
[04:34.560 --> 04:42.480]  Elvin Vaughn across from me, Darren Fingers Plowhawk. I like that to my left. Kenneth
[04:42.480 --> 04:49.280]  Iggy Sherrod wearing the nice yellow hat. And then in the Seckman studios today, helping me
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.160]  out with some of the production stuff, which has very much appreciated the great KG and O-town.
[04:54.720 --> 04:58.960]  This is the Mungenest seven o'clock hour. Get involved on the show. The EDF group text inbox.
[03:53.040 --> 03:55.040]  Seth Goldkamp is a wonderful human being.
[03:55.040 --> 03:56.040]  He can take care of you.
[03:56.040 --> 03:57.040]  He's taking care of Doug.
[03:57.040 --> 03:58.040]  He's taking care of Tim.
[03:58.040 --> 03:59.040]  He's taking care of Iggy.
[03:59.040 --> 04:00.040]  Everyone over there at Design Air, Heating and Cooling.
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.040]  Paul, can I hear a little bit about design air as the temperatures are starting to drop?
[04:04.040 --> 04:07.040]  It's a lever, Paulsy.
[04:07.040 --> 04:09.040]  It's a lever, Paulsy.
[04:09.040 --> 04:10.040]  It's starting to go up.
[04:10.040 --> 04:11.040]  Cab driver.
[04:11.040 --> 04:12.040]  60 days.
[04:12.040 --> 04:13.040]  This ain't working.
[04:13.040 --> 04:14.040]  Today, yeah.
[04:14.040 --> 04:20.040]  Design Air, Heating and Cooling is the official HVAC provider of TMA and the Tim McKernan Show
[04:20.040 --> 04:21.040]  podcast.
[04:24.040 --> 04:31.040]  And you take that and that really helps out with keeping what you got in a good place. And then this laser cap that I wear six minutes a night.
[04:31.040 --> 04:36.040]  Super easy to do and that helps with the regrowth gets that blood flow into the head helps with the regrowth of hair.
[04:36.040 --> 04:41.040]  That working in unison has really helped out my hair situation. Now for Doug, the FUE procedure.
[04:41.040 --> 04:47.040]  Every time I come into the studio, it's like your hairline drops another. I see old pictures of you and you are not the same person.
[04:47.040 --> 04:53.040]  It makes a big difference. Yeah, you look outstanding. I think you'd be amazed and maybe even stunned. Gobsmacked.
[04:58.960 --> 05:04.720]  You can text on in 314-881-TMA5. Feel free to call in because KG is back in my booth.
[05:04.720 --> 05:10.320]  636-904-TMA and then email in for the design air heating and cooling email today. That's the
[05:10.320 --> 05:16.160]  morning after at inside STL.com. I'm going to throw this out there now in case any of the sales
[05:16.160 --> 05:21.200]  people are listening. Oh, they're definitely listening at seven 10. Sure. That's what they
[05:21.200 --> 05:26.640]  listen to when they get ready to come in. Let's work once before when I said this. We are off
[04:21.040 --> 04:23.040]  You can find it at DesignAirService.com.
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.920]  And yeah, I know it's warm right now, but it's inevitably going to cool down and your
[04:28.920 --> 04:31.640]  furnace is going to be working over time.
[04:31.640 --> 04:34.280]  So when that happens, you want to make sure it's working.
[04:34.280 --> 04:40.040]  Seth Goldkamp of Design Air, Heating and Cooling says get that furnace tuned up and
[04:40.040 --> 04:48.840]  do so very easily, very quickly by going to DesignAirService.com and clicking on the book
[04:48.840 --> 04:49.840]  now tab.
[04:53.040 --> 05:00.040]  You'd be gobsmacked at the difference that it makes. So if it's something that's bothered you, always bothered you, do something about it.
[05:00.040 --> 05:06.040]  I mean, you only live once and if you don't like your hair ever, you're never really going to be happy with your appearance.
[05:06.040 --> 05:11.040]  And there's somewhere right here in St. Louis. I can take care of that. That is St. Louis hair restoration.
[05:11.040 --> 05:17.040]  They've got all kinds of options regardless of what kind of hair loss that you might have, whatever your situation is.
[05:17.040 --> 05:22.040]  Dr. Polinga and the founder, Greg Cryling, will have something to help you and help you in a big way.
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.760]  next week and then we come back on the second. Yep. But you know what January 4th is? What?
[05:31.760 --> 05:35.680]  That would be our three year anniversary. Well, two year. We've been here two years.
[05:36.720 --> 05:41.120]  Well, it'd be I guess the start of the third year. Yeah. It'll be our two year anniversary.
[05:41.120 --> 05:45.360]  The fourth. Yeah. So we want to eat cookies or anything in some balloons, maybe.
[05:45.920 --> 05:50.720]  Really? You're expecting prizes? It's a big deal. We've been here two years. I think a week off.
[04:49.840 --> 04:51.440]  That's what it done last month.
[04:51.440 --> 04:52.440]  Incredibly easy.
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.520]  They were in, they were out, and now we have peace of mind for the winter months.
[04:56.520 --> 04:58.200]  It's all at Design Air, Heating and Cooling.
[04:58.200 --> 05:03.280]  Come on out DesignAirService.com, the official HVAC provider of TMA and the Tim McKernan
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.280]  Show podcast.
[05:04.280 --> 05:05.400]  Doug Vaughn is a client.
[05:05.400 --> 05:06.880]  I am a client.
[05:06.880 --> 05:09.840]  And once you work with Design Air, you will be a client as well.
[05:09.840 --> 05:16.120]  It's Design Air, Heating and Cooling online at DesignAirService.com.
[05:16.120 --> 05:18.040]  That's Design Air, Heating and Cooling.
[05:22.040 --> 05:33.040]  Their patients are their own product, which says a lot. And truly, I would say if you're always upset by your hair and if it's worrying you, you've got to do something about it.
[05:33.040 --> 05:40.040]  And these people work miracles for a lot of people. If you go to their website, stlohseharerestoration.com, look at some of the before and after pictures.
[05:40.040 --> 05:47.040]  You'll just be blown away about what they can do for you. So check it out. You might as well call and get a consultation and see what they can do for you.
[05:51.280 --> 05:59.360]  The big deal for me because I don't usually last more than two years. Is this a record for you?
[06:00.080 --> 06:02.960]  No. I'm trying to think about so.
[06:04.480 --> 06:11.120]  920. I'm trying to think about how long of state is my longest. Well, didn't you go from like 2014
[06:11.120 --> 06:18.960]  to 2020 straight? Oh, straight. I guess what? 2019 then. Yeah. So yeah. Cause the furloughs were
[05:18.040 --> 05:21.680]  Did you ask someone to know about this Noarni guy?
[05:21.680 --> 05:22.680]  Williams Winery.
[05:22.680 --> 05:23.680]  No-wary.
[05:23.680 --> 05:24.680]  Winery.
[05:24.680 --> 05:25.680]  Five Star Plus.
[05:25.680 --> 05:27.760]  He's the consensus number one player in the country.
[05:27.760 --> 05:28.760]  Wow.
[05:28.760 --> 05:29.760]  Gotta get a drink credit.
[05:29.760 --> 05:30.760]  Oh yeah.
[05:30.760 --> 05:31.760]  Yeah.
[05:31.760 --> 05:32.760]  Yeah.
[05:32.760 --> 05:33.760]  The boosters who were paying the ILS.
[05:33.760 --> 05:34.760]  No doubt.
[05:34.760 --> 05:38.240]  But yeah, Williams Winery committed to Missouri in August.
[05:38.240 --> 05:39.600]  He made his commitment.
[05:39.600 --> 05:42.520]  If you remember, that's where people were asking Gabe to take his shirt off during that
[05:42.520 --> 05:43.520]  live broadcast.
[05:43.520 --> 05:45.900]  Well sure they were.
[05:47.040 --> 05:52.040]  Because I think you'll be very happy that you did. The website again, stlohseharerestoration.com.
[05:52.040 --> 05:55.040]  That's St. Louis hair restoration plot hawk. Do we have the audio postcard?
[05:55.040 --> 05:57.040]  I do. I was able to download it.
[05:57.040 --> 06:00.040]  All right. Awesome. So an aux is on and everything, baby.
[06:00.040 --> 06:01.040]  We're ready to roll.
[06:01.040 --> 06:09.040]  All right. Love to hear it. This is a new audio postcard from Chris Rabe. I believe it's called when Darren Slade Goliath,
[06:19.680 --> 06:25.920]  that spring best of situation. Well, the difference is I worked with some awful, awful ownership.
[06:27.600 --> 06:31.680]  No, that is very true. The complete opposite. We're working for a first class organization here.
[06:32.240 --> 06:36.160]  And some good ownership. There was some good ownership in there too. Well, the longest
[06:36.160 --> 06:41.120]  now is with Greg Marisak. Good ownership. Big league broadcasting brought in Barrett. He wanted
[06:41.120 --> 06:46.160]  his own little minions in there. So Dave Zovaras was a stand up guy. Good guy. Absolutely. I don't
[06:09.040 --> 06:21.040]  just regarding three time champion, now four time as an executive, Sean Livingston, who you dropped 25 points on low so many years ago.
[06:21.040 --> 06:30.040]  Oh, man. Surely you've heard of the rule of three. At its core, at its most innocent, it's a way to group together the functions of a story.
[05:45.900 --> 05:49.580]  And there was obviously a lot of fear that there could be a flip situation.
[05:49.580 --> 05:53.940]  But Eli Drinkwood's in his press conference after national letter of intent yesterday
[05:53.940 --> 05:56.660]  said that Williams never wavered once.
[05:56.660 --> 05:58.500]  He called him an oak.
[05:58.500 --> 06:01.220]  An oak that he was never worried that he was going to flip.
[06:01.220 --> 06:03.300]  That he always knew he was going to be a Missouri Tiger.
[06:03.300 --> 06:08.260]  And yeah, the consensus number one player in the country is a Missouri Tiger officially
[06:08.260 --> 06:09.260]  after yesterday.
[06:09.260 --> 06:10.260]  Yeah.
[06:10.260 --> 06:14.900]  So Williams Winery, superstar D.N. who could do some real damage on that defensive line
[06:46.160 --> 06:50.640]  work for Dave Zovaras. Yeah. Big fish. Either did you actually? Yes, I did. When?
[06:52.240 --> 06:57.120]  Right last part of KFNS. When? He didn't take over the station on January 1st. He was operating.
[06:57.120 --> 06:59.360]  He was operating the station there. For a couple months.
[07:00.960 --> 07:03.840]  Well, I don't care. I worked for him. I don't know. He was a terrific guy. All right. Well,
[07:03.840 --> 07:09.200]  you lasted two months and you left. I didn't. We all left. Yeah. So we lasted two months with Dave
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.520]  Zovaras. No, it seemed like it was more than two months. Well, the fact is if I had good ownership
[06:30.040 --> 06:39.040]  Narrative events, characters, but look a bit further. You might find that often bad things also come in threes.
[06:39.040 --> 06:44.040]  It took nearly two centuries, but the city of Canton, Illinois has seen such a triumvirate.
[06:44.040 --> 06:52.040]  It wasn't until early Wednesday morning after the initial shock wear off that the extent of the devastation was brought into perspective from the air.
[06:52.040 --> 06:57.040]  A wide swath of destruction was clearly the three storms, three separate storms.
[06:14.900 --> 06:18.620]  that just also added a Georgia transfer named Darius Smith.
[06:18.620 --> 06:21.060]  He's a linebacker, but he's kind of an edge rusher.
[06:21.060 --> 06:23.460]  I'm a Von Miller kind of guy.
[06:23.460 --> 06:28.740]  And yeah, so plenty of good things coming for the Missouri Tigers coming up this year.
[06:28.740 --> 06:31.460]  They also got Courtney Crutchfield and James Madison too.
[06:31.460 --> 06:33.540]  So if you're worried about, oh, we didn't get Ryan Wingo.
[06:33.540 --> 06:36.300]  There were some thoughts yesterday that there could be a possible flip.
[06:36.300 --> 06:38.380]  That didn't seem like it was actually ever going to happen.
[06:38.380 --> 06:39.860]  Wingo signed with Texas yesterday.
[06:39.860 --> 06:44.420]  But you get Courtney Crutchfield, the four star receiver from Arkansas who plenty thought
[06:57.040 --> 07:01.040]  If you were around the Canton area July 23rd, 1975.
[07:01.040 --> 07:04.040]  Each violent in their own way.
[07:04.040 --> 07:07.040]  Late that afternoon, we had a tornado.
[07:07.040 --> 07:11.040]  Two of those storms brought the region to its knees.
[07:11.040 --> 07:17.040]  It was hot, it was nuggy, and the storm hit in Canton at about two minutes after six o'clock.
[07:17.040 --> 07:25.040]  The third storm, well, it almost single handedly toppled, perhaps the greatest high school athlete the state of Illinois has ever or will ever see.
[07:13.520 --> 07:18.640]  and they appreciated what I did, I had no problem. Everybody should appreciate it. And then I had
[07:18.640 --> 07:22.880]  bad ownership and wanted to bring in people that wanted to bring in their own people. So,
[07:23.920 --> 07:28.400]  you know, Barrett didn't need me because I was a good producer. He brought in people that didn't
[07:28.400 --> 07:31.520]  know what they were doing so he could tell them what to do and he could basically produce all the
[07:31.520 --> 07:40.800]  shows himself. So I was out Springfield, terrible owner. Spent four years in San Francisco. Well,
[07:25.040 --> 07:32.040]  This is a story about that third storm.
[07:32.040 --> 07:39.040]  Welcome to 30 for 30.
[07:39.040 --> 07:43.040]  I scored 25 points against Sean Livingston.
[07:43.040 --> 07:45.040]  It's so calm.
[07:45.040 --> 07:48.040]  Welcome to Darren and Goliath.
[06:44.420 --> 06:46.020]  was going to be a Razorback.
[06:46.020 --> 06:49.420]  And then you also get James Mass and who they call Prez, Doug, they call him Prez.
[06:49.420 --> 06:50.420]  Prez.
[06:50.420 --> 06:51.420]  Because his name's James Mass.
[06:51.420 --> 06:52.420]  Yes, of course.
[06:52.420 --> 06:53.580]  From Texas, who's also a stud receiver.
[06:53.580 --> 06:58.280]  So the receiver room next year, if Theo Wiese comes back, could be very robust with Luther
[06:58.280 --> 07:03.100]  Burden obviously entering his last year before being eligible for the NFL Draft.
[07:03.100 --> 07:07.140]  Now I keep seeing all this great Mizzou recruiting success.
[07:07.140 --> 07:11.420]  And then I see where they're ranked 24th best recruiting class in the country.
[07:40.800 --> 07:44.640]  I've nothing but good things to say about Dave Zovaras who continued to pay me for four months,
[07:44.640 --> 07:47.920]  even though I wasn't working. I didn't say anything bad about him. I'm just saying we didn't really
[07:47.920 --> 07:53.280]  work for him long enough. I'm saying bad ownership, you know, lasted a couple years. You know, he only
[07:53.280 --> 07:58.400]  took over for a few months. Big M-I-Z guy that Dave Zovaras. True son is what he is. You know,
[07:59.040 --> 08:04.080]  the Atlanta guys were good until they ran out of money and they had a custom buddy and I was the
[07:55.040 --> 07:56.040]  It was amazing.
[07:56.040 --> 08:03.040]  Yeah, I saw my will never ever forget.
[08:03.040 --> 08:14.040]  It would almost be boring to list the accomplishments of Sean Livingston in his Illinois high school basketball career.
[08:14.040 --> 08:24.040]  It would not be overstating to say that perhaps the greatest athlete in nay, but the state of Illinois, if not the entire United States in the early 2000s.
[08:24.040 --> 08:37.040]  A common refrain as you saw it heard into a gym was to hear someone say it's almost as if God created the game of basketball for Sean Livingston.
[08:37.040 --> 08:47.040]  In consecutive years, 1999 and 2000, before he would enter high school, Livingston captained the Peoria Concordia Cougars to Lutheran Sports Association titles.
[08:47.040 --> 08:53.040]  The most prestigious grade school competition conglomerate in the state of Illinois.
[07:11.420 --> 07:15.980]  And there are 11 SEC teams with classes ranked above theirs.
[07:15.980 --> 07:20.220]  So I'm surprised it's not better if you're a top 10 team right now.
[07:20.220 --> 07:23.420]  They have to do better than this just to stay where they're at.
[07:23.420 --> 07:24.420]  Right.
[07:24.420 --> 07:29.260]  The transfer ratings, based on transfers that they've gotten, they're a little bit higher.
[07:29.260 --> 07:35.140]  A guy like Caden Green, who is the best offensive tackle in the portal, Taranio Pride, who was
[07:35.140 --> 07:38.580]  the best corner, and then Marcus Carroll, the fourth best running back.
[07:38.580 --> 07:41.300]  So they did some good work on that side.
[08:04.080 --> 08:11.520]  cut instead of Pradjo. So it was pretty much always their fault and never yours? I think
[08:11.520 --> 08:18.480]  one was my fault when I disobeyed Dave Green and got Tim a porn star and he fired me. And I even
[08:18.480 --> 08:25.760]  told him, I said, like, hey, you know, I disobeyed you. That's a hell of a reason. I get it. You told
[08:25.760 --> 08:31.280]  me not to do something. I did it. So yeah, so I own up to that one. But the rest of them is either
[08:53.040 --> 09:07.040]  Each year, Livingston was named the tournament's most outstanding player and his team never lost a game.
[09:07.040 --> 09:09.040]  In fact, they never trailed.
[09:09.040 --> 09:17.040]  So it's understandable that one might furrow their brow when hearing that a boy three years his junior would be the one they called giant slayer.
[08:31.280 --> 08:35.120]  ran out of money or new ownership. I never did anything wrong. Hey guys, what's the comedy
[08:35.120 --> 08:40.560]  denominator here that's from mid your match. Every time I got fired equals terrible owner.
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.800]  Got it. That's from Jonathan Mardukas. I do believe in charity. Here's one. Six months. That one.
[08:46.800 --> 08:57.520]  He was a tough one. I've been with TMA for god, almost seven years now. But a two year anniversary
[07:41.820 --> 07:45.340]  Yeah, the SEC is going to be tough, but you get the number one consensus player in the
[07:45.340 --> 07:50.500]  country, Williams Winery, that can offset, as you know, a defensive end can make such
[07:50.500 --> 07:53.060]  a big difference in the game if you get one of those guys.
[07:53.060 --> 07:55.780]  Five of the top eight recruiting classes are SEC teams.
[07:55.780 --> 07:57.840]  Yeah, yeah, that's going to happen.
[07:57.840 --> 08:01.300]  So yeah, you're going to have to keep doing this all the time just to stay where you're
[08:01.300 --> 08:02.300]  at.
[08:02.300 --> 08:06.980]  But if you look at the progress, how often 10 years ago where they get number one guys,
[08:06.980 --> 08:10.660]  like Luther Burden and Williams Winery, almost never it felt like.
[09:18.040 --> 09:19.040]  Three year age difference.
[09:19.040 --> 09:20.040]  I think I was 10.
[09:20.040 --> 09:21.040]  He was 13.
[09:21.040 --> 09:22.040]  I was right before he went to the big.
[09:22.040 --> 09:25.040]  He's covering an NBA player three years older than you.
[09:25.040 --> 09:29.040]  The details come and go as Darren Atkins recounts that day.
[09:29.040 --> 09:34.040]  I was a three year age guy because you couldn't find enough competition in that area.
[09:34.040 --> 09:37.040]  You had to kind of spread out the ages a little bit more and you all.
[09:37.040 --> 09:43.040]  But like any epic passed down from generation to generation, the words somehow become more vibrant.
[09:43.040 --> 09:45.040]  I dropped 25 on that night.
[08:57.520 --> 09:02.000]  is not a real long anniversary. No, it's not. If you can't last at least two years, then you've
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.160]  done something. Well, the thing is to two years and we've I've been I think most of us have happy
[09:08.160 --> 09:13.040]  for two years. We're like coming to the station and you love the people you work with you love
[09:13.040 --> 09:20.400]  the people you work for. Not one problem whatsoever. That's hard to say in this business. Even with
[09:20.400 --> 09:26.640]  good ownership, you know, you're gonna have maybe a coworker that you can't get along with I get
[08:11.380 --> 08:14.700]  DGB, yeah, DGB, that was a great one.
[08:14.700 --> 08:18.940]  But that was like, you know, it was so celebrated because they just didn't get that now coming
[08:18.940 --> 08:19.940]  off the heel.
[08:19.940 --> 08:24.300]  I mean, since 2017, you had number one player in basketball committed to Missouri with
[08:24.300 --> 08:29.380]  Michael Port Jr., Luther Burden staying closer to home, and then Williams Winery, who's Lee
[08:29.380 --> 08:30.620]  Summit North, Doug.
[08:30.620 --> 08:32.940]  Three guys from Lee Summit North could be on the line next year.
[08:32.940 --> 08:36.420]  I would think the transfer portal is more important even than the high school recruiting.
[09:45.040 --> 09:50.040]  Everybody remembered where they were almost more implausible and unbelievable.
[09:50.040 --> 09:52.040]  I think a one three one zone.
[09:52.040 --> 09:53.040]  I was up at the top of the key.
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.040]  In fact, downright crazy.
[09:56.040 --> 09:57.040]  Twenty five on Livingston.
[09:57.040 --> 10:05.040]  That kids digs in and insists on some wildly impractical and seemingly unnecessary aspects of the story.
[10:05.040 --> 10:06.040]  You were hot that night.
[10:06.040 --> 10:09.040]  I was on fire deep.
[10:09.040 --> 10:10.040]  These are long shot.
[10:10.040 --> 10:11.040]  These are layups or anything.
[10:11.040 --> 10:13.040]  No, no, it's just the corner shooter.
[09:26.640 --> 09:32.000]  along with everybody. Well, not really. Who? We got one here working today. He doesn't work here.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.680]  He's not working today. He's taking a trip. He doesn't work here. I'm talking about people
[09:37.680 --> 09:46.720]  that are here every day. Well, he does work here. Thanks, Doug. Even you're here now. I rest my case.
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.200]  It does seem like a fair point. Iggy Aryan Gervins is the true spirit of Christmas. That's from Tracy
[08:36.940 --> 08:42.620]  Because it's more important and more beneficial to get a guy who's 21 or 22 and has been working
[08:42.620 --> 08:46.060]  out and had the training table food for three years and he's learned how to play and you
[08:46.060 --> 08:50.820]  know that he can play as opposed to some 17 year old kid who's got a lot of growing to
[08:50.820 --> 08:52.700]  do and growing up at the same time.
[08:52.700 --> 08:56.900]  I am outspoken about how much I love the NIL.
[08:56.900 --> 08:59.780]  I love how the college landscape is now.
[08:59.780 --> 09:04.700]  Kids have a voice, kids have decisions, options, and they're getting paid for what they do
[09:04.700 --> 09:06.340]  instead of the University pocketing.
[10:13.040 --> 10:15.040]  Well, that's tough a shot there on the floor.
[10:15.040 --> 10:16.040]  The corner.
[10:16.040 --> 10:18.040]  A bunch of layups or were you red hot from outside?
[10:18.040 --> 10:20.040]  I mainly shot corner threes.
[10:20.040 --> 10:21.040]  Corner threes.
[10:21.040 --> 10:22.040]  Yeah.
[10:22.040 --> 10:24.040]  And how at what age?
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.040]  I think I was 11 or 12.
[10:25.040 --> 10:26.040]  Something like that.
[10:26.040 --> 10:27.040]  And you're hitting a bunch of corner three points.
[10:27.040 --> 10:28.040]  Three pointer swings.
[10:28.040 --> 10:29.040]  Here come the farmers.
[10:29.040 --> 10:31.040]  Here come the plow boys.
[10:31.040 --> 10:36.040]  Livingston after the game gave you a fist pound and said, I guess we'll do this in the NBA someday.
[10:36.040 --> 10:38.040]  Onlookers were yelling, that's not Sean Livingston.
[10:38.040 --> 10:39.040]  What are you talking about?
[09:53.200 --> 09:59.280]  Woods. I think I'm in the holiday spirit now. I just said how happy we are here going on our two
[09:59.280 --> 10:02.800]  year anniversary is the fourth wins Festivus again. That's when you really hear that. Oh,
[10:02.800 --> 10:06.560]  it's Saturday. That's when you can really start airing out your grievances. I'm not an airing
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.920]  grievance. I'm just saying two years is just let everybody have me. There's nobody to let have it.
[10:11.920 --> 10:16.640]  You just blistered a number of people who all the past owners you work for. Well, they weren't good.
[09:06.420 --> 09:10.700]  I do find it funny though, the number one offensive lineman who I think just four days
[09:10.700 --> 09:16.660]  ago was on ESPN, he committed to Colorado, had Colorado gear talking about, hey, you
[09:16.660 --> 09:19.180]  know, Deon Sander did it at the highest level.
[09:19.180 --> 09:20.180]  He has a gold jacket.
[09:20.180 --> 09:21.180]  You know, I can't wait to play for him.
[09:21.180 --> 09:22.980]  This is four days ago.
[09:22.980 --> 09:24.980]  He committed to Maryland yesterday.
[09:24.980 --> 09:32.220]  So like, it just, you go on TV four days prior talking about can't wait to play for a coach,
[09:32.220 --> 09:34.020]  this and that awesome University.
[10:16.640 --> 10:25.440]  What do you want me to say? Well, they did pay your salary for a while. Put food on your table,
[10:25.440 --> 10:31.360]  roof over your head, whether you like to or not. Well, they did. It doesn't mean they were good.
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.800]  Well, that means you still have to respect that they hired you for a while and gave you a paycheck.
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.040]  I'm just saying Hubbard is great people. It's good being here because we have great people,
[10:39.040 --> 10:43.040]  He's literally three years older than you and one of the best players in the entire country.
[10:43.040 --> 10:44.040]  Not that athletic.
[10:44.040 --> 10:45.040]  Not that big.
[10:45.040 --> 10:51.040]  Did the Canton times pick you and get a picture of Plowsey and Livingston's jersey swap?
[10:51.040 --> 10:53.040]  This has been 30 for 30.
[10:53.040 --> 10:55.040]  On that night, everybody remembered where they were.
[10:55.040 --> 10:59.040]  This is when Darren beat Goliath.
[11:02.040 --> 11:03.040]  I like the news.
[11:03.040 --> 11:04.040]  I like the old school news.
[11:04.040 --> 11:05.040]  30 for 30.
[11:05.040 --> 11:08.040]  From the tornadoes of Canton's pass.
[09:34.020 --> 09:37.020]  You can't wait to get the boulder and you know, get there and play it and you commit
[09:37.020 --> 09:41.140]  to the University of Maryland with not a powerhouse either.
[09:41.140 --> 09:42.980]  And I, again, it should be all about money.
[09:42.980 --> 09:46.740]  You should, you shouldn't think about the next level because you may never get there.
[09:46.740 --> 09:49.780]  Injuries, you know, you never know what can happen.
[09:49.780 --> 09:52.260]  You got to pocket as much money as you can while you can.
[09:52.260 --> 09:54.740]  So I don't blame, I do find those interviews funny as hell.
[09:54.740 --> 09:56.740]  For years and it still goes on.
[09:56.740 --> 09:58.780]  Coaches have said, no, I'm committed to this university.
[09:58.780 --> 10:02.340]  Yeah, I'm never considered going somewhere else and then the next day the news conference
[10:02.340 --> 10:03.340]  is that he's leaving.
[10:43.040 --> 10:48.080]  great people running the station. And it's fun to get up every day and come and see you guys.
[10:48.720 --> 10:53.760]  There are times when you get up in the morning, God, what's going to happen today? I don't want
[10:53.760 --> 10:57.440]  to go in there. You know, I can't tell you how many times I went on my vacation in Jamaica for
[10:57.440 --> 11:00.960]  two and I was gone for two weeks every year. It took two weeks off before Christmas to go to
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.960]  Hito. And there were times I was at Hito. I was just, I was still a nervous wreck saying,
[11:04.960 --> 11:09.280]  I wonder if I got a job when I get back. That's tough. Again, I'm enjoying the show.
[11:08.040 --> 11:11.040]  And everything was disrupted.
[11:11.040 --> 11:12.040]  I've seen the video.
[11:12.040 --> 11:14.040]  I felt like video was going along with that.
[11:14.040 --> 11:20.040]  He was very, he's very good at the intros to those with the emotional music.
[11:20.040 --> 11:21.040]  He finds everything too.
[11:21.040 --> 11:22.040]  Let's do a little digging.
[11:22.040 --> 11:23.040]  He does.
[11:23.040 --> 11:25.040]  Yeah, like I don't remember that segment.
[11:25.040 --> 11:26.040]  Had to be the athletic.
[11:26.040 --> 11:27.040]  I don't remember saying it.
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.040]  Cheap people remember where they were at that time.
[11:30.040 --> 11:32.040]  And they knew how good you were because I mean, what were you back then?
[11:32.040 --> 11:33.040]  About 5'2?
[11:33.040 --> 11:35.040]  Oh, I couldn't tell you my stats.
[11:35.040 --> 11:36.040]  10 years.
[10:03.340 --> 10:04.340]  Yeah.
[10:04.340 --> 10:09.460]  So I love that there's, you know, a little bit more of an even playing field with coaches,
[10:09.460 --> 10:13.260]  universities and play like, I like that aspect.
[10:13.260 --> 10:19.540]  I just don't love the, I'm 110% committed and then two days later you're 110% committed
[10:19.540 --> 10:20.540]  to somewhere else.
[10:20.540 --> 10:24.380]  I just love that sort of comedy aspect.
[10:24.380 --> 10:28.140]  Even if you're, even if this guy was 110% committed to Colorado, he could have been
[10:28.140 --> 10:31.580]  115% committed to Maryland.
[11:09.280 --> 11:13.840]  I am too, base burglar. That's tough. You know what I did is I know, you know, that's tough.
[11:13.840 --> 11:18.160]  Another beautiful day. God, I'm gonna get back in 12 days and probably gonna get fired.
[11:18.160 --> 11:24.880]  Well, I got fired and rehired in the matter of a six hour float trip. Um, but what I, what I
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.080]  loved about it was I actually the other day went back and looked at some of the, like the emails.
[11:30.080 --> 11:36.240]  I'm not gonna say name, but just for management, you know, uh, from previous regimes and man,
[11:36.040 --> 11:37.040]  But at that time, I'm...
[11:37.040 --> 11:38.040]  6'7, I guarding.
[11:38.040 --> 11:44.040]  Yeah, but your normal size at that time for a 10, like it's not like I was, you know,
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.040]  small my entire life, but people eventually start to grow and you don't.
[11:48.040 --> 11:53.040]  But like at 10 or 11, you're kind of in the same size factor.
[11:53.040 --> 11:56.040]  Livingston never recovered from the gobsmacking he delivered?
[11:56.040 --> 11:59.040]  Well, he won three titles as a player and won as an executive.
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.040]  So I think he went just fine.
[12:00.040 --> 12:02.040]  Was he a top five pick out of high school?
[12:02.040 --> 12:03.040]  Six.
[10:31.580 --> 10:34.700]  Now do I have the decision that just said 5%.
[10:34.700 --> 10:40.220]  I got a text here from Kwame Vayukis, Von Miller kind of guy, he had eight tackles this
[10:40.220 --> 10:41.220]  year.
[10:41.220 --> 10:42.220]  Have some shame, Jack.
[10:42.220 --> 10:47.340]  When I mentioned the Von Miller comp, I was mentioning a linebacker who lines up on the
[10:47.340 --> 10:49.460]  edge, not the kind of player he is.
[10:49.460 --> 10:50.460]  I do like Lawrence.
[10:50.460 --> 10:55.300]  You were mentioning more like a Lawrence Taylor type of player of all time.
[10:55.300 --> 10:57.060]  Then it would be, yeah, got that dick back kiss.
[10:57.060 --> 11:00.220]  No, I'm talking about the position he plays where he's a linebacker, but he lines up more
[11:36.240 --> 11:42.880]  I forgot how much gold is in my Yahoo email. Oh, really? A lot of punctuation. Oh, it just,
[11:42.880 --> 11:49.920]  just one long sentence, one 500 word sentence, one period at the end. Simply stated the ordinary
[11:49.920 --> 11:58.640]  paragraphs. Yeah. It's so I, I kind of like that you can get over those things. You can get past
[11:58.640 --> 12:04.000]  that as humans because it's a reading some of those. I'm like, how, how am I in this career?
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.040]  Yeah, he was going to go to Duke, but he...
[12:06.040 --> 12:09.040]  No, he was fourth overall to the Clippers.
[12:09.040 --> 12:13.040]  I mean, so he was really three years older than you and you're playing against him?
[12:13.040 --> 12:14.040]  So this wasn't...
[12:14.040 --> 12:16.040]  It's not A, this is just summer league ball.
[12:16.040 --> 12:22.040]  So like, there is like a Peoria because Peoria had a private high schools and public high
[12:22.040 --> 12:23.040]  schools, similar to here.
[12:23.040 --> 12:25.040]  Can't know just obviously I won high school.
[12:25.040 --> 12:30.040]  So it would be just like in the area tournament, not worth traveling to Orlando, taking a bunch
[12:30.040 --> 12:32.040]  of farm boys.
[12:04.960 --> 12:09.680]  Yeah. Look at me. What is wrong with me? That's why I really want to write this book because I
[12:11.680 --> 12:16.320]  have content you can absolutely have in 32 years in this thing. I mean, I've got stories. So I want
[12:16.320 --> 12:21.440]  to, I want to play this out. Let's say no ghost writer. You're writing the book. How would you
[12:21.440 --> 12:27.920]  approach the process? Would you just open up a that the desktop and just start hammering on
[11:00.220 --> 11:03.060]  on the defensive line to rush the passer.
[11:03.060 --> 11:06.380]  That's what I meant by Von Miller type, but I understand where you're confused.
[11:06.380 --> 11:09.020]  Doug, where do you think Luther Bird will transfer to?
[11:09.020 --> 11:10.900]  It's from Worsham, Woods, Waco.
[11:10.900 --> 11:14.180]  Oh, probably Georgia, Alabama, something like that.
[11:14.180 --> 11:15.780]  I don't think he's going anywhere.
[11:15.780 --> 11:19.780]  KJ Bolden, the number one safety and who has been committed to Florida State for a year
[11:19.780 --> 11:22.780]  and a half the last day, committed to Georgia.
[11:22.780 --> 11:27.020]  I mean, they literally, we talk about backing up the Brinks truck and I kind of think that
[12:32.040 --> 12:37.040]  But you play a lot of people way before high school that are, you know, from Peoria, from
[12:37.040 --> 12:39.040]  that Rich Woods area.
[12:39.040 --> 12:43.040]  Well, if you weigh 115 now as a 30 year old grown man, what'd you weigh back when you
[12:43.040 --> 12:44.040]  were 10 years old?
[12:44.040 --> 12:45.040]  For real.
[12:45.040 --> 12:47.040]  Honestly, I don't know what the stat...
[12:47.040 --> 12:48.040]  20, 25 pounds?
[12:48.040 --> 12:51.040]  It's like an infant baby.
[12:51.040 --> 12:52.040]  Like a coyote.
[12:52.040 --> 12:53.040]  Like a coyote.
[12:53.040 --> 12:54.040]  The basketball.
[12:54.040 --> 12:55.040]  You had to probably...
[12:55.040 --> 12:56.040]  Do you have to chuck that up with two hands?
[12:56.040 --> 12:57.040]  It's a little like...
[11:27.020 --> 11:30.020]  that's what is actually happening now.
[11:30.020 --> 11:36.180]  Like they're going to their homes with black suits, sunglasses, two briefcase full of cash
[11:36.180 --> 11:41.140]  with a letter of intent and that's like how it gets done now, which again, I love.
[11:41.140 --> 11:44.860]  Mizzou has the top transfer class based on average star rating for any school with at
[11:44.860 --> 11:45.860]  least four transfers.
[11:45.860 --> 11:47.700]  That comes from Larry Thornton.
[11:47.700 --> 11:52.020]  So that can offset some of the recruiting rankings that you were talking about.
[11:52.020 --> 11:55.900]  I mean, yeah, when you look at it, offensive line, Javon Foster, who was a stud this year,
[12:27.920 --> 12:33.920]  the keys? The problem is I still have, I still have like notes, but it's on a floppy disc. I don't
[12:33.920 --> 12:39.280]  even know if I can play that anymore. Keeps the doctor away. So it's safe to say that these
[12:39.280 --> 12:43.520]  stories aren't very current. You know, I started doing the book alone. Where would you even put
[12:43.520 --> 12:49.440]  a floppy disk? I don't know. Were you? I don't think I can use it anymore. The floppy disc wasn't
[12:49.440 --> 12:56.560]  even popular when I was born. Oh, we had, I had floppy disc of a cruising USA. Remember that
[12:57.040 --> 13:03.040]  So I had like a side shooter for like a while because when you're that size, like it's
[13:03.040 --> 13:04.040]  hard to do.
[13:04.040 --> 13:05.040]  You had to hurl it.
[13:05.040 --> 13:06.040]  Yeah.
[13:06.040 --> 13:07.040]  Sling shot motion.
[13:07.040 --> 13:08.040]  I think that's what it was called.
[13:08.040 --> 13:09.040]  The sling shot motion or the sideways motion.
[13:09.040 --> 13:10.040]  I was playing grade school.
[13:10.040 --> 13:12.040]  I was throwing underhanded for my free throws.
[13:12.040 --> 13:13.040]  I couldn't get it up there.
[13:13.040 --> 13:15.040]  You and Rick Berry.
[13:15.040 --> 13:16.040]  Mike did it because I couldn't.
[13:16.040 --> 13:18.040]  Well, I was strong enough to get it up there.
[13:18.040 --> 13:19.040]  So I had to...
[13:19.040 --> 13:21.040]  The best way to shoot free throws is the underhand granny shot.
[13:21.040 --> 13:22.040]  A lot of them used to do it.
[13:22.040 --> 13:23.040]  They used to.
[13:23.040 --> 13:24.040]  Like NBA pushes.
[13:24.040 --> 13:25.040]  Jackie Moon.
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.280]  wasn't it cruising world cruising something to where you're a trucker and you
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.840]  hiked it up cross country and the graphic for basically just you first person and like this
[13:07.840 --> 13:12.960]  terrible semi truck and floppy disc just kind of slid into your computer like a CD and it popped up
[13:12.960 --> 13:18.160]  like a file on your computer. Like it would be like a USB drive and you click on that. And that's
[13:18.160 --> 13:21.200]  where I put all these notes. I would just be sitting at home. I think of another story.
[13:22.240 --> 13:25.360]  And instead of Johnny down on paper, like I used to do with my phone numbers,
[11:55.900 --> 11:58.540]  you replaced him with Caden Green running back Cody Schrader.
[11:58.540 --> 12:00.100]  Obviously it was a superstar.
[12:00.100 --> 12:02.700]  You replaced him with Marcus Carroll who could be very capable.
[12:02.700 --> 12:06.540]  And then Chris Abrams drain on us, Rake Strong corner back, neither of which have declared
[12:06.540 --> 12:10.220]  for the NFL draft, which Gabe mentioned on power of Mizzou that calm yesterday, which
[12:10.220 --> 12:13.060]  was popping off these past couple of days.
[12:13.060 --> 12:15.740]  Shout out to Gabe for that and drank with bats in those.
[12:15.740 --> 12:16.740]  Yeah.
[12:16.740 --> 12:20.980]  And you go get Toronto pride to replace either of those two if they choose to go play for
[12:20.980 --> 12:23.220]  the NFL, which I would assume they would.
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.440]  I would just go to the computer, type more in and save it on the floppy disc. So I said,
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.840]  if I start this thing, I can go to the floppy disc and I got all the things that I, in case I
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.240]  forgot them. That's a good question, Jackson. I'm not sure how to approach it because I don't,
[13:41.280 --> 13:45.600]  I mean, there's a lot of things in my life that have been entertaining, like all the girls I've
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.680]  slept with and all the people I've met and things like that are floppy all the places I've been.
[13:50.400 --> 13:55.040]  So that's not really radio current. So it would be more like an autobiography,
[12:23.220 --> 12:25.780]  You don't want to love most about the tramp report on.
[12:25.780 --> 12:28.260]  I think the younger Macklin is a great example.
[12:28.260 --> 12:31.980]  You're a little bit of a late bloomer, so you're not highly recruited.
[12:31.980 --> 12:35.460]  You're going to, you know, a lower D1 in North Texas.
[12:35.460 --> 12:37.460]  We use him as a real example.
[12:37.460 --> 12:38.860]  Go to North Texas.
[12:38.860 --> 12:41.700]  Obviously he's blossomed into his first two years.
[12:41.700 --> 12:43.460]  I think he had a thousand yards, 55.
[12:43.460 --> 12:44.460]  Who are you talking about?
[12:44.460 --> 12:45.460]  Inceptions.
[12:45.460 --> 12:46.460]  The younger Macklin.
[12:46.460 --> 12:47.460]  Oh, Jay.
[12:47.460 --> 12:48.460]  Yeah.
[12:48.460 --> 12:51.900]  And so he had the opportunity not to die on a vine at North Texas just because at 17
[13:25.040 --> 13:28.200]  I feel like a real man and shoot with proper form.
[13:28.200 --> 13:29.200]  I think I'm with you though.
[13:29.200 --> 13:30.200]  I don't know if I could just...
[13:30.200 --> 13:31.200]  No, you can't.
[13:31.200 --> 13:32.200]  Do it granny style.
[13:32.200 --> 13:33.200]  You can't be up there granny style.
[13:33.200 --> 13:35.640]  Walk off the court with any sort of pride left on me.
[13:35.640 --> 13:36.640]  Yeah.
[13:36.640 --> 13:37.640]  Come on.
[13:37.640 --> 13:38.640]  You could shoot a 15 foot jumper.
[13:38.640 --> 13:40.160]  Are you sure there's no video from that game?
[13:40.160 --> 13:41.160]  Your parents didn't shoot at all?
[13:41.160 --> 13:44.040]  You can't be so like summer league game just for like fun.
[13:44.040 --> 13:46.400]  Like I said, it wasn't AYBT.
[13:46.400 --> 13:47.900]  It wasn't AAU.
[13:47.900 --> 13:48.900]  None of that.
[13:48.900 --> 13:50.960]  It was just such a historic moment that we would like to see.
[13:50.960 --> 13:53.560]  I don't even know if AAU was even prevalent.
[13:55.040 --> 14:01.840]  which nobody's going to read. But if it was a sports book about, you know, being a producer
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.720]  in sports radio for 30, I bet a lot of radio station people would buy that because they'd
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.240]  be interested in behind the scenes of what goes on in sports radio. Do it as an audio book.
[14:12.240 --> 14:19.040]  I like that idea. I have to read. Yeah. So I haven't read a book in a while. How do books start?
[12:51.900 --> 12:57.300]  or 18 he wasn't developed into a four star and he's able to go to a power five school.
[12:57.300 --> 13:01.860]  Get North Texas a little bit on the map, get him some experience and now he's able to play.
[13:01.860 --> 13:05.540]  I don't know if he committed or not anywhere, but he's able to play at a top tier universe.
[13:05.540 --> 13:06.540]  I'm sorry.
[13:06.540 --> 13:07.540]  That was Jamori Macklin.
[13:07.540 --> 13:08.540]  Jamori.
[13:08.540 --> 13:09.540]  And then Schrader did the same thing.
[13:09.540 --> 13:13.220]  You don't, you'll never see those guys do what they're doing, these stories without this
[13:13.220 --> 13:16.700]  tramp for rule because they would just be at the school they went to.
[13:16.700 --> 13:21.740]  They'd have to use a year of eligibility and tramp for before this weren't really
[13:53.560 --> 13:58.960]  Like AYBT was what like summer league travel basketball was called.
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.480]  I don't know if AAU bought that out or it was called AYB.
[14:02.480 --> 14:03.480]  So Livingston wasn't traveling.
[14:03.480 --> 14:05.480]  He was just playing in a summer fun game?
[14:05.480 --> 14:07.200]  Sure he did eventually.
[14:07.200 --> 14:09.160]  But like I said, we're kids at the time.
[14:09.160 --> 14:10.920]  They didn't rate seventh graders.
[14:10.920 --> 14:12.620]  They do now.
[14:12.620 --> 14:15.960]  They have guys that are like four stars that are in the 2028 client.
[14:15.960 --> 14:19.640]  That was not a thing 15, 20 years ago.
[14:19.640 --> 14:21.560]  It's just not a thing.
[14:19.920 --> 14:22.720]  Once upon a time. Boy, it was the best of times.
[14:24.880 --> 14:30.560]  Like I'm trying to think in terms of the Iggy radio book, what would be the first set? You know
[14:30.560 --> 14:36.000]  what I mean? You'd need an epilogue. Oh, yeah. Good morning, everyone. How the hell did I get
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.880]  into this business? There's your first set. I mean, that should be the title and the first set.
[14:40.880 --> 14:44.640]  You started with, I was in Jamaica and I was wondering if my job would be there for when I
[13:21.740 --> 13:23.700]  looked at as highly coveted recruits.
[13:23.700 --> 13:28.380]  You know, somebody who was disgruntled or kicked off the team looking for a new team.
[13:28.380 --> 13:33.740]  This gives the guys ability to be late bloomers, still have the ability to play at a power five
[13:33.740 --> 13:34.740]  conference.
[13:34.740 --> 13:35.740]  Definitely man.
[13:35.740 --> 13:38.360]  It just means that the recruiting process is nonstop.
[13:38.360 --> 13:40.220]  You have guys monitoring the portal.
[13:40.220 --> 13:43.100]  I think Gabe said that literally their job at the moderate 24 hours.
[13:43.100 --> 13:46.460]  Can't have entire office buildings full of people recruiting nonstop.
[13:46.460 --> 13:51.340]  Have you seen anything in the last year or so?
[14:21.560 --> 14:27.000]  So like when he was 15 or 14, then he did the AAU with like the Peoria Heat.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.880]  I think it went through AAU team and then obviously you're surrounded by Chicago talent.
[14:31.880 --> 14:34.440]  Like I mean, you just stay.
[14:34.440 --> 14:37.320]  You delivered him a beat down that served him a heaping portion of home.
[14:37.320 --> 14:40.400]  Oh, and by the way, Daniel Ruffin was on that court.
[14:40.400 --> 14:44.440]  Four year Bradley starter, won a couple of state titles with Peoria with Sean Livingston.
[14:44.440 --> 14:45.960]  He was on the same team?
[14:45.960 --> 14:47.480]  He was a fantastic player.
[14:47.480 --> 14:49.560]  Well, they played the other players that you were lighting.
[14:44.640 --> 14:48.960]  returned back in the sun. This job was so great that I have two weeks in Jamaica and I was
[14:48.960 --> 14:55.120]  stressed out every day. Wonder if I got a job when I get back. I don't know. I would probably,
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.680]  if I'm going to do it all about radio, I would start in the beginning and then kind of go through
[14:59.680 --> 15:07.760]  certain periods of stations and ownership and people I work with the good times, some of the
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.480]  bad people I worked with, some of the bad people I had to produce their shows. I think you'd start
[13:51.340 --> 13:55.180]  On what happened to Dorial Greenback and what he's doing now.
[13:55.180 --> 13:56.900]  Ooh, I haven't seen an insider.
[13:56.900 --> 14:01.220]  I know he had a rough post football career.
[14:01.220 --> 14:02.220]  He started off with a rough man.
[14:02.220 --> 14:03.220]  Yeah, he got arrested a few times.
[14:03.220 --> 14:06.260]  I think he spent some time in jail in Springfield.
[14:06.260 --> 14:08.100]  But I mean he had two fairly decent years.
[14:08.100 --> 14:10.340]  I mean he was drafted what, second round?
[14:10.340 --> 14:11.340]  I think he played for the Titans.
[14:11.340 --> 14:12.340]  He was drafted by the Titans.
[14:12.340 --> 14:16.340]  I think he had like five, six hundred yards receiving.
[14:16.340 --> 14:17.340]  Then he was traded to Philadelphia.
[14:17.340 --> 14:20.020]  And I think he had a pretty decent year with Philadelphia.
[14:49.640 --> 14:55.160]  Well, they were from the same area and they put on the same team for their entire lives,
[14:55.160 --> 14:58.320]  like traveling, middle school, high school.
[14:58.320 --> 14:59.320]  They were good.
[14:59.320 --> 15:00.320]  You were knocking them down from the corner?
[15:00.320 --> 15:01.320]  Yeah.
[15:01.320 --> 15:02.320]  Don't forget about-
[15:02.320 --> 15:03.320]  That's the best place to do it from.
[15:03.320 --> 15:07.440]  Yeah, don't forget about Matt Roth, who went to University of Indiana, I think was a two
[15:07.440 --> 15:08.440]  year starter.
[15:08.440 --> 15:12.120]  He was in our conference from Washington University.
[15:12.120 --> 15:13.120]  There were some studs.
[15:13.120 --> 15:14.560]  De'Aaron Williams went to Wisconsin.
[15:14.560 --> 15:15.840]  He was from Limestone.
[15:15.840 --> 15:17.480]  He played that year.
[15:17.480 --> 15:19.160]  And you took the measure of all of them.
[15:12.480 --> 15:16.560]  it with one of the highlights of your life just to get people interested. There I was in bed with
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.680]  Leona Helmsley, the queen of mean. And then take it from there. How it came to that. You got to
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.760]  that point. And little did I know that two years later I'd be working in sports radio. Oh, I thought
[15:25.760 --> 15:31.200]  she ran out of time. I wish there was somebody to incorporate like an audio book with a book.
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.440]  Like you almost almost like a pop-up book, but you know, you're talking about Leona Helmsley and
[15:35.440 --> 15:40.800]  you got this little button you can press for like a little second from the interview or a drop,
[15:40.800 --> 15:48.080]  you know, to really get that, you know, that mental image. So I'm laying in Bermuda. I'm laying in a
[15:48.800 --> 15:54.400]  hotel room in Bermuda as I work there. Beautiful, beautiful place. So happy.
[15:55.280 --> 15:58.480]  And as Leona Helmsley leans over and says, do you want to have coffee?
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.200]  I'll let I know that two years later she would be in jail and I'd be working in sports radio.
[16:05.920 --> 16:09.840]  Sounds like a best seller to me. And so begins. What you're waiting on.
[14:21.020 --> 14:22.020]  Then he was done.
[14:22.020 --> 14:24.340]  I don't know if it was his legal problems, but it was always pot.
[14:24.340 --> 14:29.020]  Except for I think it was assault and resisting arrest where he spent 180 days in jail.
[14:29.020 --> 14:33.180]  But most of the other ones were, I think there's a DWI in there that was a pot possession.
[14:33.180 --> 14:34.180]  Yeah, you're not going to...
[14:34.180 --> 14:36.740]  He's probably the most gifted athlete I've seen in a long time.
[14:36.740 --> 14:38.580]  But it wasn't like he was a dud in the NFL.
[14:38.580 --> 14:39.580]  I mean he had...
[14:39.580 --> 14:40.580]  But he's a knucklehead.
[14:40.580 --> 14:43.940]  Yeah, you're not going to last very long if you're a knucklehead.
[14:43.940 --> 14:45.420]  Is the juice worth the squeeze on a guy?
[14:45.420 --> 14:48.020]  I think the coaches and organizations like weigh that.
[14:48.020 --> 14:49.580]  Because he is a freak, man.
[15:19.160 --> 15:22.880]  Brian Randall, Peoria Notre Dame, a year before my high school started.
[15:22.880 --> 15:23.880]  No, I didn't play anything.
[15:23.880 --> 15:26.720]  I'm saying Illinois high school basketball is the best in the country.
[15:26.720 --> 15:27.720]  Oh, wow.
[15:27.720 --> 15:32.000]  It's not even close to me that Illinois had the best talent in basketball.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  That's a big old take.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.160]  And when I was in school, I mean, John Shire, Derrick Rose.
[15:36.160 --> 15:37.720]  Pat Bev scoring 37 at Marshall.
[15:37.720 --> 15:38.720]  Yeah, Jermaine Richmond.
[15:38.720 --> 15:42.120]  I mean, you had obviously Jabari Parker.
[15:42.120 --> 15:43.120]  They had everybody, man.
[15:43.120 --> 15:44.120]  That was so fun to go out.
[15:44.120 --> 15:47.840]  And for you to pretty much dominate at the 10 year old level, it shows quite a bit.
[16:10.480 --> 16:14.800]  I'm literally on the edge of my seat right now. Hey guys, what's more likely to happen? The
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.600]  Cardinals have a 350 million dollar payroll or Iggy writing this book that comes from Mayor Don.
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.440]  Yeah, you're not gonna write it. If you don't like to read, you're certainly not gonna write.
[16:23.440 --> 16:28.560]  Yeah, there is kind of correlation there. But you do like to read. You said you like to read.
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.360]  Hoxie said he would write it for me. Ben Hochman. And we're in the press box one day and I guess he
[16:33.360 --> 16:36.240]  listened to the show and he'd heard me talking about the book and he goes, by the way, I'll
[14:50.140 --> 14:57.740]  Because he went on and off on Mizzou, but he had a really good year or two there at Mizzou.
[14:57.740 --> 14:58.740]  He was sick.
[14:58.740 --> 14:59.740]  He was fun to watch.
[14:59.740 --> 15:00.740]  Yeah, they went to Oklahoma.
[15:00.740 --> 15:01.740]  I forgot he went to Oklahoma.
[15:01.740 --> 15:04.780]  He was on the practice squad and then was drafted in the second round.
[15:04.780 --> 15:07.060]  Yeah, because everyone knew how talented he was.
[15:07.060 --> 15:08.260]  He just had messed around.
[15:08.260 --> 15:11.980]  I think his first two catches of the NFL were touchdowns.
[15:11.980 --> 15:14.900]  I don't know if he made enough money to live on.
[15:14.900 --> 15:18.700]  I mean, I think he signed with Tennessee if I remember correctly because I remember when
[15:47.840 --> 15:48.840]  We didn't dominate.
[15:48.840 --> 15:49.840]  We lost by like 28, 30.
[15:49.840 --> 15:50.840]  You heard that quip.
[15:50.840 --> 15:52.840]  They never like they were dominant.
[15:52.840 --> 15:55.440]  You might want to get out of that one, three, one.
[15:55.440 --> 15:57.280]  Oh, you couldn't just know.
[15:57.280 --> 16:01.680]  I mean, teams like that have such an advantage if you have any sort of athletic ability.
[16:01.680 --> 16:03.520]  It takes one player.
[16:03.520 --> 16:07.680]  So Kent was kind of behind the times because AAU basketball started like 40 years ago.
[16:07.680 --> 16:08.960]  Yeah, I know.
[16:08.960 --> 16:09.960]  We didn't hear.
[16:09.960 --> 16:14.840]  We just did any traveling basketball we did was, you know, it was local.
[16:14.840 --> 16:16.160]  So it was everybody from Ken.
[15:18.700 --> 15:19.700]  he was drafted.
[15:19.700 --> 15:25.260]  I think he got a $3 million contract for four years or something like that.
[15:25.260 --> 15:27.900]  $3 million guarantee and a $2 million signing bonus.
[15:27.900 --> 15:28.900]  That's $5 million.
[15:28.900 --> 15:31.820]  I'm reading that he got arrested a couple times on marijuana possession.
[15:31.820 --> 15:34.140]  Then a DWI in 2017.
[15:34.140 --> 15:39.980]  In 2018, he arrested in Springfield possession of controlled substance and resisting arrest.
[15:39.980 --> 15:44.300]  August of 21, arrested in Kansas City for assault charges, property damage, resisting
[15:44.300 --> 15:45.300]  arrest.
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.880]  write the book for you if you want. I'll be the author. He might be requesting some payment.
[16:40.880 --> 16:44.400]  Oh yeah, that's fine. Would you give him payment or would you give him a piece
[16:44.400 --> 16:48.240]  price on the brick, a little piece of the action? You know, he gets 10%.
[16:48.240 --> 16:51.040]  I don't know. He would take it all just like Rocky takes the cameo money.
[16:51.040 --> 16:53.920]  I would have to talk to the publisher and say, what am I getting out of this?
[16:54.720 --> 16:59.200]  And you know, this might be a self published situation. I give Hoxie 20%.
[16:59.760 --> 17:05.360]  Biff publishing. Yeah, I don't know. I mentioned there's some local publishers in town.
[16:16.160 --> 16:18.680]  There were two teams, an A and a B team.
[16:18.680 --> 16:19.840]  And we did.
[16:19.840 --> 16:22.840]  And the most you travel with is like Southern and Northern Illinois.
[16:22.840 --> 16:23.840]  And these were foreign players.
[16:23.840 --> 16:24.840]  Iowa maybe on occasion.
[16:24.840 --> 16:25.840]  So it wasn't AAU.
[16:25.840 --> 16:28.080]  It was not the AAU circuit.
[16:28.080 --> 16:32.000]  But I think for the lesser players who just wanted to have traveling basketball, there
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  were so good players.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.160]  How many of them had to bail hay and slop the hogs before the first tip off?
[16:36.160 --> 16:38.160]  There's only a couple of farmers, I would say.
[16:38.160 --> 16:41.160]  We're you know, most of them lived in town.
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.920]  Dad was an insurance guy.
[16:42.920 --> 16:44.920]  You know, Molly.
[15:45.300 --> 15:50.860]  In 2021, sentenced to 180 days in Greene County jail for violation of probation.
[15:50.860 --> 15:55.580]  Yeah, NFL head coaches see that and that's something.
[15:55.580 --> 15:56.580]  They don't need it.
[15:56.580 --> 15:57.700]  There's always another guy coming up.
[15:57.700 --> 16:02.660]  The goal for guys like that, though, get to that pension.
[16:02.660 --> 16:03.660]  Five years.
[16:03.660 --> 16:07.780]  I remember the kid out of Canton who drafted in the fifth round by the Chiefs in oh, 506.
[16:07.780 --> 16:08.780]  I forgot.
[16:08.780 --> 16:12.660]  Really good friends with Larry Johnson, really good friends with Tony Gonzalez at the time.
[17:06.560 --> 17:12.320]  Um, I don't know. I mean, I like to do it. I like never do it. I like writing.
[17:12.320 --> 17:16.560]  You'll never sit down for even 10 minutes to write an outline. I will never do it.
[17:16.560 --> 17:20.000]  I don't think I keep telling Tim I'll write a chapter and I'm bringing in. I never do.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.400]  No, you won't even write the outline. Well, the fact that your notes are still on a floppy disk
[17:24.400 --> 17:27.680]  doesn't get me much confidence. Considering it's the year 2023.
[17:27.680 --> 17:29.600]  Like you've already pushed it off 40 years.
[17:30.480 --> 17:33.920]  It wouldn't take me long to come up with things. I'll go year by year,
[16:44.920 --> 16:46.880]  A hospital representative.
[16:46.880 --> 16:50.080]  Like Johnny Appleseed's out there.
[16:50.080 --> 16:51.600]  Yeah, not the 1920.
[16:51.600 --> 16:53.680]  We're not showing up in horse and carriage.
[16:53.680 --> 16:54.680]  Well, you never know.
[16:54.680 --> 16:55.680]  Those kids play too.
[16:55.680 --> 16:59.920]  But if you look at Alice Ingersoll gym, because our high school gym was separate from where
[16:59.920 --> 17:04.520]  our high school was, that was one of the best high school gyms I've ever been to where we
[17:04.520 --> 17:05.520]  played at.
[17:05.520 --> 17:06.520]  It was so fun.
[17:06.520 --> 17:08.080]  It's like historic.
[17:08.080 --> 17:09.080]  It's not on campus.
[17:09.080 --> 17:10.080]  You know, it's really cool.
[17:10.080 --> 17:11.080]  Like your whole arena.
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.080]  Like your own separate arena.
[16:12.660 --> 16:15.900]  They were both there.
[16:15.900 --> 16:19.860]  He had three and a half, four years, kind of bounced around, moved from linebacker to
[16:19.860 --> 16:26.740]  fullback, four and a half years, got cut, missed his pension by five games.
[16:26.740 --> 16:32.660]  That's like the goal to get the 175 base salary for the rest of your life, full medical, full
[16:32.660 --> 16:33.660]  benefits.
[16:33.660 --> 16:39.980]  I mean, that to me, if I'm a player like that, just last five years on a roster.
[17:33.920 --> 17:36.640]  station by station and I'll call people who also work there.
[17:37.280 --> 17:40.640]  You know, try to get some things to remember this happening because I'm going to have to verify
[17:40.640 --> 17:43.840]  this stuff. I can't just because there's going to be people that want to sue me. I know.
[17:45.040 --> 17:49.040]  So I'm going to have to have these things verified by a couple of people who were there
[17:49.040 --> 17:53.760]  who can say, yeah, that happened. So if somebody wants to sue me, I can tell the publisher,
[17:53.760 --> 17:56.480]  look, I got two people that will back me up on this. So we're good.
[17:56.480 --> 17:59.840]  That'll be a fun way to spend your golden years in court litigating.
[17:14.080 --> 17:18.080]  Jackson was using granny style shot at his rec league the other night.
[17:18.080 --> 17:21.520]  He squatted so low you could see the shiny plug peeking out of his balloon.
[17:21.520 --> 17:22.520]  No.
[17:22.520 --> 17:24.360]  That's for Mr. Siders.
[17:24.360 --> 17:25.360]  Never would shoot like granny style.
[17:25.360 --> 17:26.360]  Wait, were we not huggers?
[17:26.360 --> 17:27.840]  I would never shoot granny style.
[17:27.840 --> 17:29.760]  I think they should bring those back.
[17:29.760 --> 17:31.040]  What is granny style?
[17:31.040 --> 17:32.040]  That's the underhand.
[17:32.040 --> 17:34.640]  Underhand like free throw.
[17:34.640 --> 17:36.200]  I don't know if it's more accurate though.
[17:36.200 --> 17:40.160]  To me, I would never be able to make that as opposed to a normal free throw.
[17:40.160 --> 17:41.160]  No.
[17:41.160 --> 17:42.160]  Shoot.
[16:39.980 --> 16:45.080]  But look at what we saw here from guys like Isaac Bruce and Torrey Holt, who probably
[16:45.080 --> 16:48.300]  had no more physical ability than D'Oreal Green Beckham.
[16:48.300 --> 16:51.300]  And yet they were top notch guys all the way.
[16:51.300 --> 16:52.300]  Yeah.
[16:52.300 --> 16:56.300]  And they had fantastic careers and made multiple millions of dollars and they're going to live
[16:56.300 --> 17:00.580]  on easy street the rest of their life because they behave themselves.
[17:00.580 --> 17:06.220]  There is zero, and I mean zero chance that Boots knew new details of the guaranteed money
[17:06.220 --> 17:07.980]  in DGB's contract.
[17:59.840 --> 18:01.920]  Well, this is true.
[18:01.920 --> 18:04.320]  You're going into your fourth court case.
[18:04.320 --> 18:05.120]  No, no, no.
[18:05.120 --> 18:06.880]  Hockman moves into his house in Hawaii.
[18:07.920 --> 18:11.440]  Now there's one chapter that that I already know what I want to do. And I
[18:11.440 --> 18:16.480]  guarantee this guy will try to sue me. So no, no, you're going to have to go through with it.
[18:17.840 --> 18:21.360]  I'd like to give Plazia a compliment real quick. Last night on my way home from work,
[18:21.360 --> 18:25.360]  after a busy day, I got much needed laughs with the deek, throw them emails. Best of playing.
[18:25.360 --> 18:28.480]  Truly one of the funniest bits in this show's history. Thank you,
[17:07.980 --> 17:11.420]  That's where Googling and then trying to flex you rusted old bike chain.
[17:11.420 --> 17:12.420]  Hey.
[17:12.420 --> 17:13.420]  Why didn't Google anything?
[17:13.420 --> 17:18.020]  I mean, he was a Missouri player, so we followed what he did.
[17:18.020 --> 17:21.580]  So are they mad that we, and I know this is great being a loved one, but like, so when
[17:21.580 --> 17:24.820]  we throw out facts and we didn't look it up, we get completely scolded.
[17:24.820 --> 17:27.900]  You have a computer in front of your face, dumbass, look it up.
[17:27.900 --> 17:32.980]  So now like we're looking things up, getting accurate stats and information, and now we're
[17:32.980 --> 17:36.740]  getting grew because we're looking up and what do you want us to do?
[17:36.740 --> 17:37.740]  Shut up the whole time.
[17:42.240 --> 17:46.760]  I think it's probably a softer shot because the ball's kind of going up as opposed to
[17:46.760 --> 17:48.680]  coming down with force.
[17:48.680 --> 17:49.680]  I don't want to.
[17:49.680 --> 17:50.680]  You should always shoot on the way up.
[17:50.680 --> 17:52.360]  Do not understand the peach basket aspect.
[17:52.360 --> 17:53.360]  I realize with the game.
[17:53.360 --> 17:54.360]  That was what they had, bro.
[17:54.360 --> 17:56.800]  Like, no, but I'm saying why didn't they open up the bottom?
[17:56.800 --> 17:58.200]  They never understood why like.
[17:58.200 --> 18:01.680]  I think they did eventually, but they used to climb up in the ladder and pull the ball
[18:01.680 --> 18:02.680]  out of the corner.
[18:02.680 --> 18:05.160]  I meant the first time you made a shot and you're getting out a ladder to get the ball
[18:05.160 --> 18:06.160]  out of it.
[18:06.160 --> 18:07.760]  That's when you realize, okay, let's open this up.
[18:07.760 --> 18:08.760]  Let's just have a drop through.
[18:28.480 --> 18:31.440]  Plathawk. That comes from Eric in the central West End.
[18:31.440 --> 18:37.280]  You got it. I will warn people or just let people know in advance. We are running through them. So
[18:37.280 --> 18:42.080]  I'm trying to periodically load them in. Obviously during the holiday, 10 days of not being able to
[18:42.080 --> 18:49.200]  do that. You may hear things you've heard five days ago instead of usually 10 or 12 days. So
[18:49.200 --> 18:55.120]  we're going to alleviate that with a bunch of stuff being loaded in. But yeah, it's getting
[17:37.820 --> 17:38.820]  I didn't look it up.
[17:38.820 --> 17:40.980]  It's just, I was a big, well you did.
[17:40.980 --> 17:41.980]  That was very good.
[17:41.980 --> 17:44.180]  I remember it as a rest record because it was always in the paper.
[17:44.180 --> 17:45.620]  I don't remember all of his arrests.
[17:45.620 --> 17:46.620]  And I followed him.
[17:46.620 --> 17:52.180]  I mean, you know, when you like a guy who goes to Mizzou, you know, when he was a Springfield
[17:52.180 --> 17:56.860]  guy, so I still follow people from Springfield.
[17:56.860 --> 17:59.860]  So he's a local guy, you kind of follow those guys.
[17:59.860 --> 18:06.980]  You know, I followed when, who's that kid from St. Louis who became a kicker for Phoenix?
[18:55.120 --> 18:59.840]  hit a little bit. So I appreciate the compliment. Just during my holiday break, I really don't want
[18:59.840 --> 19:06.800]  any personal DMS, any emails about the skeleton. Let's just all wait until we get back from
[19:06.800 --> 19:11.440]  holiday. Yeah, let it rip. Let it rip on Tuesday the second. Put it down in your floppy disk. Some
[19:11.440 --> 19:19.760]  complaints you may have popping in and on the floppy disk. Remember how loud it was to just
[18:08.760 --> 18:13.320]  For a while, it was legal to sit in the balcony above that with like an umbrella and swat
[18:13.320 --> 18:14.320]  the balls away.
[18:14.320 --> 18:15.320]  Stop.
[18:15.320 --> 18:16.320]  Is it really?
[18:16.320 --> 18:17.320]  Yeah, that's what I read at some point.
[18:17.320 --> 18:18.320]  Like a three stooges bet.
[18:18.320 --> 18:20.760]  Yeah, you could play defense up there and swat the ball away.
[18:20.760 --> 18:22.840]  Jackson, can I ask you a dumb basketball question?
[18:22.840 --> 18:26.000]  I always will take any basketball question, dumb or smart.
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.720]  Are you allowed to jump on a free throw?
[18:28.720 --> 18:29.720]  Yes.
[18:29.720 --> 18:30.720]  Okay.
[18:30.720 --> 18:31.720]  Do you mean as you shoot?
[18:31.720 --> 18:32.720]  Yeah.
[18:32.720 --> 18:33.720]  You can't cross the line.
[18:33.720 --> 18:34.720]  Or you're sitting there waiting for the rebound.
[18:34.720 --> 18:35.720]  No, no, no.
[18:35.720 --> 18:37.240]  Like, can you shoot a jump shot as a free throw?
[18:37.240 --> 18:38.240]  Yes.
[19:19.760 --> 19:26.960]  be on a computer? Putting that floppy disk in, I can almost hear it now. It's almost like you're
[19:26.960 --> 19:33.440]  buying a jet engine and then trying to get the internet loaded. It just sounds like a fire alarm.
[19:34.400 --> 19:40.080]  You could never be incognito trying to go onto the worldwide web because right when you turn on
[19:40.080 --> 19:46.480]  that Gateway 98, it just sounds like you're turning on a helicopter. Then you got the dial up.
[18:07.980 --> 18:08.980]  Remember him?
[18:08.980 --> 18:09.980]  Yeah.
[18:09.980 --> 18:10.980]  He followed his career.
[18:10.980 --> 18:13.100]  He was just a field goal kicker, but he's a local guy.
[18:13.100 --> 18:14.100]  Neil Rackers?
[18:14.100 --> 18:15.100]  Neil Rackers.
[18:15.100 --> 18:16.100]  We followed him so much we don't know his name.
[18:16.100 --> 18:17.100]  Well, it was a long time.
[18:17.100 --> 18:18.100]  It was a long time ago.
[18:18.100 --> 18:20.100]  But we were the St. Louis kids, so yeah.
[18:20.100 --> 18:21.780]  Yeah, his mom was always on too.
[18:21.780 --> 18:22.780]  I remember that.
[18:22.780 --> 18:24.420]  I mean, I follow people like that.
[18:24.420 --> 18:28.540]  So I remember, I remember his first two catches in the NFL or touchdowns, I believe, with
[18:28.540 --> 18:29.540]  Tennessee.
[18:29.540 --> 18:30.540]  You're correct.
[18:30.540 --> 18:31.540]  Third player ever to do it.
[18:31.540 --> 18:32.540]  I looked that up.
[18:32.540 --> 18:34.540]  Yeah, but you follow things like that and they're in the paper.
[18:34.540 --> 18:35.540]  Yes!
[18:38.600 --> 18:41.120]  As long as you don't land in front of the free throw line.
[18:41.120 --> 18:46.600]  Now, there's been taught, like I remember growing up that I was told you can't jump,
[18:46.600 --> 18:51.360]  but I at least, and maybe it's different in the NBA or something, but from my experience,
[18:51.360 --> 18:52.360]  you can.
[18:52.360 --> 18:56.560]  Just know what it does because you're now adding a huge variable in which it's jumping.
[18:56.560 --> 18:58.880]  A 15 foot set shot is quite easy.
[18:58.880 --> 19:01.120]  I think I've actually seen people take jump shots there.
[19:01.120 --> 19:02.120]  Yeah.
[19:02.120 --> 19:03.120]  Not many of us.
[19:03.120 --> 19:04.320]  You just can't land in front of the free throw.
[19:04.320 --> 19:07.560]  Now, is it legal as you're sitting there waiting for the rebound to jump?
[19:46.640 --> 19:49.920]  Oh yeah. And you get in the middle of something and somebody gets on the phone, you get knocked
[19:49.920 --> 19:55.280]  off. Who's on the phone? I'm on the computer. As soon as the phone got picked up, the computer went
[19:55.280 --> 20:01.920]  off. Having to tune between keeping your phone home phone line on or switching it to internet.
[20:01.920 --> 20:07.200]  I know we had that issue of, you know, we have internet for an hour a day because we have these
[20:07.200 --> 20:11.680]  phone calls, these home phone calls that are absolutely a necessity. Well, look how far it's
[18:35.940 --> 18:39.460]  People were still covering even though he wasn't here.
[18:39.460 --> 18:42.500]  So if I needed to look something up, I'd say, I don't know.
[18:42.500 --> 18:44.500]  How many times do I say, I'm not going to look it up?
[18:44.500 --> 18:45.500]  Often.
[18:45.500 --> 18:46.820]  So I just have somebody else look it up.
[18:46.820 --> 18:47.820]  Those are just things that I stuck out.
[18:47.820 --> 18:49.620]  Right, because it's so hard to do.
[18:49.620 --> 18:52.140]  I just don't care now.
[18:52.140 --> 18:53.140]  It's time consuming.
[18:53.140 --> 18:54.940]  It's labor intensive.
[18:54.940 --> 18:58.460]  I almost hope I had the wrong information when I'm giving a take.
[18:58.460 --> 19:01.820]  Speaking of wrong information, Paul, I'm going to call for some audio.
[19:01.820 --> 19:03.780]  Yesterday, Doug, my SportsCenter update.
[20:11.680 --> 20:17.040]  coming 30 years though. Now we're watching TV on our phones. That's crazy. We don't have internet.
[20:17.040 --> 20:20.960]  We're paralyzed. What? No internet. I can't continue. The reason I brought that up because
[20:20.960 --> 20:25.920]  I saw it on Twitter the other day and it kind of hits you like a bolt of lightning, Doug, as you'd
[20:25.920 --> 20:32.240]  like to say. The internet used to be like a space. Like when you went online, you're not in your car,
[20:32.240 --> 20:38.080]  you're not out and about. You actually had to go to this huge desk with your desktop and you get
[19:07.560 --> 19:09.920]  Or is it just bad sportsmanship to do it?
[19:09.920 --> 19:10.920]  You cannot.
[19:10.920 --> 19:13.640]  That would be a lane violation, but you can move on the release.
[19:13.640 --> 19:16.040]  Once the person releases the shot, you can then do whatever you want.
[19:16.040 --> 19:21.360]  I know you can go inside the lane at that point, but if you're in your spot where you
[19:21.360 --> 19:23.480]  have to be, can you move around and jump around?
[19:23.480 --> 19:24.480]  No.
[19:24.480 --> 19:26.360]  That would be a violation.
[19:26.360 --> 19:28.840]  I think that would add some color to the game though if you could.
[19:28.840 --> 19:30.720]  There's guys who like clapping stuff.
[19:30.720 --> 19:33.960]  I've seen guys get called on stuff like that where you get an extra free throw because
[19:33.960 --> 19:35.500]  you do dumb crap like that.
[20:38.080 --> 20:44.800]  your mouse and it's slow. It's not super fast. You can't get any like everything like instantaneously.
[20:44.800 --> 20:50.320]  And once you log off and leave that desk, you kind of leave the internet behind. I love the technology
[20:50.320 --> 20:56.320]  now. Obviously there are some kinks to it. But thinking about that, how simple the world was
[20:56.320 --> 21:03.200]  when you just left kind of that virtual reality behind. I've told this story before. I'll tell
[21:03.200 --> 21:07.600]  it again because we have new people. The people cycle on Iggy and they cycle off.
[19:03.860 --> 19:07.140]  I named who the Blues are playing tonight.
[19:07.140 --> 19:08.140]  Do you know who they're playing tonight?
[19:08.140 --> 19:11.100]  Tonight, they're playing a team that's coming here looking for a couple points.
[19:11.100 --> 19:12.100]  I know that.
[19:12.100 --> 19:13.100]  They'll actually be there.
[19:13.100 --> 19:14.100]  They're playing the floor of the Panthers.
[19:14.100 --> 19:15.100]  Yeah.
[19:15.100 --> 19:16.100]  Oh, that's right.
[19:16.100 --> 19:22.620]  And so on the board up at 101 ESPN, we have a little TV that says all the things that
[19:22.620 --> 19:26.380]  are coming up on the station, like Blues games, they'll be on NFL games, they'll be
[19:26.380 --> 19:32.220]  on the radio, whatever it is, baseball games, all that stuff is all up there.
[19:35.500 --> 19:39.820]  If you felt more comfortable a foot back, can you shoot it further behind the line?
[19:39.820 --> 19:40.820]  Sure.
[19:40.820 --> 19:41.820]  You can shoot.
[19:41.820 --> 19:43.580]  As long as you are behind the free throw line, you can shoot.
[19:43.580 --> 19:46.340]  You can do it from the elbow if you want.
[19:46.340 --> 19:50.140]  I have seen that where guys are better elbow shooters than they shoot from the elbow.
[19:50.140 --> 19:52.980]  There was a time when Will Chamberlain would get hacked all the time and couldn't make
[19:52.980 --> 19:55.420]  a free throw because he had a horrible outside shooter.
[19:55.420 --> 19:58.540]  He'd stand at the very back of the circle.
[19:58.540 --> 20:03.180]  When he started shooting overhand and fire these line drives up to the hoop.
[21:07.600 --> 21:13.280]  But it's about Jay Jr. and anytime I can tell a Jay Jr. story I'm going to. It's the first time
[21:13.280 --> 21:19.280]  I ever saw a computer. It was Jay. He was living over at Brentwood Forest, which used to be Audubon
[21:19.280 --> 21:23.360]  when he lived there, I think. And he called me and he goes, dude, you got to come over.
[21:23.360 --> 21:29.280]  Just got this computer. My uncle sent me a nude picture. I go, what? He goes, yeah. He goes,
[21:29.280 --> 21:34.000]  it's amazing. He comes up on the computer. I said, all right. So I came over and he popped open up
[19:32.220 --> 19:34.560]  And it just said Blues at Panthers.
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.460]  So I read that so I can tell people on SportsCenter update what time the pregame starts and everything.
[19:38.460 --> 19:40.620]  And all it says is Blues at Panthers.
[19:40.620 --> 19:43.380]  So Play the audio from out of sports.
[19:43.380 --> 19:47.660]  101 ESPN SportsCenter.
[19:47.660 --> 19:51.780]  This is Action Jackson with a SportsCenter update driven by Johnny Londoff Chevrolet
[19:51.780 --> 19:54.460]  and Johnny Londoff Auto Plex.
[19:54.460 --> 19:57.900]  The Blues lose last night to Tampa Bay Lightning.
[19:57.900 --> 19:59.860]  Final score of six to one.
[20:03.180 --> 20:05.300]  Now I was always confused.
[20:05.300 --> 20:07.500]  Shaq was the same way, couldn't hit a free throw.
[20:07.500 --> 20:11.980]  Guys who have been playing basketball probably since they were four or five years old, almost
[20:11.980 --> 20:17.060]  every day of their life, still can't have normal form and kind of a soft jump shot.
[20:17.060 --> 20:21.580]  You never get, you got all this athletic ability, you play all the time and you never develop
[20:21.580 --> 20:22.580]  anything like a shot.
[20:22.580 --> 20:25.940]  I see the big guys are used to dunking the ball or laying it up that they got to shoot.
[20:25.940 --> 20:28.140]  But that's not all that they do.
[20:28.140 --> 20:30.740]  And nowadays we've proven that big guys can't shoot.
[19:59.860 --> 20:04.100]  The Blues are back in action tomorrow night taking on the Carolina Panthers.
[20:04.100 --> 20:05.720]  Taking on the Florida Panthers.
[20:05.720 --> 20:09.780]  Pregame starts at 5 p.m. and the puck drops at 6 p.m.
[20:09.780 --> 20:11.540]  You caught yourself though.
[20:11.540 --> 20:12.540]  Yeah.
[20:12.540 --> 20:13.540]  I was surprised you did.
[20:13.540 --> 20:17.260]  And the best part about this is people who never mess up in their lives at all are going
[20:17.260 --> 20:18.260]  after them.
[20:18.260 --> 20:19.260]  Right.
[20:19.260 --> 20:20.260]  It's all in good fun.
[20:20.260 --> 20:24.340]  Tim, as soon as I said that, why not the biggest laugh?
[20:24.340 --> 20:26.500]  And it was really hard for me to collect my...
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.360]  Budweiser. He goes, now watch. He just clicked this. It's going to download. Okay. He's like,
[21:41.600 --> 21:49.600]  like a little bar. What is that? Let's download it. Okay. We were there for an hour. He goes,
[21:49.600 --> 21:54.560]  look, look, there's the nipple. We've been here an hour. What does this do? He goes,
[21:54.560 --> 21:58.720]  it's going to be a naked picture. I just go up on a Playboy. He goes, yeah, but isn't it cool? You
[21:58.720 --> 22:02.480]  can just somebody can send it to you. Open it up on this thing and it comes up. I said, well,
[20:30.740 --> 20:33.260]  Some of the bigger guys in the league or some of the best shooters in the league.
[20:33.260 --> 20:34.700]  They work on it.
[20:34.700 --> 20:36.100]  Probably Shaq, probably never worked on shooting.
[20:36.100 --> 20:39.820]  He's so big he was just under the basket, getting the thing and laying it up there.
[20:39.820 --> 20:41.380]  Game was a touch different back then.
[20:41.380 --> 20:45.740]  I saw Mad Dog put Moses Malone over Shaq in the best centers and it was...
[20:45.740 --> 20:46.740]  Out of his mind.
[20:46.740 --> 20:47.740]  It was one of the most embarrassing.
[20:47.740 --> 20:48.740]  That's when...
[20:48.740 --> 20:49.740]  Yeah, out of his mind.
[20:49.740 --> 20:56.820]  When he does his best, Mad Dog, I love him, but when he did his best QB tight end tandem,
[20:56.820 --> 21:00.460]  there's nothing more embarrassing than sort of sports hot take than that.
[22:02.640 --> 22:05.120]  we've been here an hour though. It's going to take you an hour and we saw a nipple.
[22:05.840 --> 22:09.680]  That's the first time I ever saw a computer. And that's how long it took to download files.
[22:10.400 --> 22:14.480]  Hey guys, I'll tell this story again. It should be the name of the book. It comes from wedding tackle.
[22:15.760 --> 22:24.640]  Get involved. Send your text in EDF group text inbox, 314-881-TMA5. Feel free to call in 636-904-TMA.
[22:24.640 --> 22:30.240]  We'll make a little press conference Thursday. Why not? And the Mungenest is the presenting
[20:26.500 --> 20:29.900]  There was a big pause and then I of course get into John Moran's game winner from two
[20:29.900 --> 20:30.900]  nights ago.
[20:30.900 --> 20:31.900]  But...
[20:31.900 --> 20:32.900]  You sat back at home.
[20:32.900 --> 20:33.900]  Everybody's done that.
[20:33.900 --> 20:35.500]  If you've done this enough, sooner or later you'll see it.
[20:35.500 --> 20:39.860]  I just saw Panthers and said, Caroline, so right when we started the next day, Tim goes,
[20:39.860 --> 20:40.860]  so they're playing Bryce Young tonight.
[20:40.860 --> 20:41.860]  Is that...
[20:41.860 --> 20:45.780]  I think if your hockey reputation wasn't there, that wouldn't have been a big of a deal.
[20:45.780 --> 20:46.780]  Yeah.
[20:46.780 --> 20:48.580]  I caught myself immediately when I said it.
[20:48.580 --> 20:50.780]  But like I never think of the Florida Panthers.
[20:50.780 --> 20:51.780]  Like truly, I never...
[20:51.780 --> 20:52.780]  But you're a puck head.
[20:52.780 --> 20:53.780]  Yeah.
[20:53.780 --> 20:54.780]  Right.
[21:00.500 --> 21:01.500]  That was always like Bart Starr.
[21:01.500 --> 21:07.220]  Yeah, Bart Starr and like Kramer, who's fine, but like they have like 16 career touchdowns.
[21:07.220 --> 21:08.220]  Kelsey and Mahoney do that and like...
[21:08.220 --> 21:09.860]  Well, they used to run the ball all the time.
[21:09.860 --> 21:13.100]  I get it, but you can't possibly...
[21:13.100 --> 21:17.580]  I know you can't judge arrows with football because it's completely different now.
[21:17.580 --> 21:24.060]  But to say Bart Starr and Kramer were one of the best tight end QB duos...
[21:24.060 --> 21:29.460]  The running backs back then used to have good names like John Henry Johnson and Dick Bass.
[22:30.240 --> 22:34.880]  sponsor of the seven o'clock hour. Hey Plowhawk, can I hear a little bit about the wonderful people
[22:34.880 --> 22:43.520]  over there at Mungenest? Mungenest, St. Louis Acre, Mungenest Burger, Alton Toyota, the official
[22:43.520 --> 22:49.760]  automotive provider of TMA, the Tim McKernan show, and the presenting sponsor of Balloon Party online
[22:49.760 --> 22:57.040]  at stlouisacre.com and altontoyota.com. And on top of that, not only do they want you to do business,
[20:54.780 --> 20:56.900]  I never, ever think of them.
[20:56.900 --> 20:58.220]  No, not once.
[20:58.220 --> 21:04.540]  Me and Jason, right next, behind Phil Mickelson in a Florida Panthers game once.
[21:04.540 --> 21:07.220]  Kodak Black enjoys a Panthers game.
[21:07.220 --> 21:08.220]  He does.
[21:08.220 --> 21:10.700]  He had some fun at one of those Panthers games.
[21:10.700 --> 21:11.700]  So I brought up my next point.
[21:11.700 --> 21:15.900]  I feel like I'm just copying myself from balloon party, but what the hell?
[21:15.900 --> 21:20.700]  I said I like teams that use the state name instead of the city name.
[21:20.700 --> 21:21.700]  You do.
[21:21.700 --> 21:23.660]  I think in certain cases.
[21:29.460 --> 21:33.020]  Pong, Ronnie Bull, Joe Don Looney.
[21:33.020 --> 21:34.580]  They sounded like running backs.
[21:34.580 --> 21:38.380]  Speaking of Shaq, just for a moment, I was watching and I talked to Tim about this month
[21:38.380 --> 21:41.180]  or two ago and I've asked a couple of my buddies if they think it's true.
[21:41.180 --> 21:46.540]  Shaq Klain, he was on Tom Brady's podcast a little like a couple months ago and he claims
[21:46.540 --> 21:54.700]  in that third championship of the Lakers, that'd be 2002, that he weighed 415 pounds.
[21:54.700 --> 21:57.780]  So that'd been like his prime.
[22:57.040 --> 23:00.320]  then they want you to feel comfortable doing business with them. So they give out a number
[23:00.320 --> 23:06.880]  that is only for our listeners so you can text or call with questions or requests you may have.
[23:06.880 --> 23:20.800]  It is the secret number and the secret number is as follows. 314-252-0029. That's 314-252-0029.
[23:20.800 --> 23:24.640]  And now you're dealing with the people we deal with. Jamie Burkhardt, Clayton Patterson, Peter
[21:57.780 --> 22:00.460]  415 pounds.
[22:00.460 --> 22:02.500]  That's literally three and a half me's.
[22:02.500 --> 22:03.500]  I'm not kidding.
[22:03.500 --> 22:04.900]  I'm one of his legs.
[22:04.900 --> 22:06.380]  415 pounds.
[22:06.380 --> 22:11.860]  I don't know if you could move like he did if you weighed 415 pounds.
[22:11.860 --> 22:16.260]  Well, you couldn't move with our muscles and our bone structure, but if everything about
[22:16.260 --> 22:17.780]  you was that big and strong.
[22:17.780 --> 22:22.780]  There's a 15-year-old right now from DeSoto, Texas that's 6'8", 355 or 360.
[22:22.780 --> 22:25.580]  He's 15 years old.
[21:23.660 --> 21:26.820]  Like I mentioned yesterday on balloon party, all my friends who live...
[21:26.820 --> 21:31.100]  I have a bunch of friends from Memphis and they love the Titans, but I don't think that
[21:31.100 --> 21:34.300]  they would be as much in love with the Titans if they were the Nashville Titans and not
[21:34.300 --> 21:36.340]  the Tennessee Titans.
[21:36.340 --> 21:37.340]  My friends don't like Nash...
[21:37.340 --> 21:41.740]  Well, they like going to Nashville, but they don't like Vander Builder and the University
[21:41.740 --> 21:42.740]  of Tennessee teams.
[21:42.740 --> 21:45.700]  They're not into that, but they do love the Titans.
[21:45.700 --> 21:47.140]  Or like Carolina Panthers.
[21:47.140 --> 21:48.140]  Perfect example.
[21:48.140 --> 21:50.220]  You cover both North and South Carolina.
[21:50.220 --> 21:51.220]  Florida...
[21:51.220 --> 21:52.220]  You're not going to be the Miami Panthers.
[21:52.220 --> 21:53.220]  They don't play at Miami.
[23:24.720 --> 23:28.400]  Mungenest, Ryan Seiberg in the service department. Even if you didn't eat your car from Mungenest,
[23:28.400 --> 23:33.360]  get it serviced at Mungenest with their incredible service department or just go online and check
[23:33.360 --> 23:39.280]  out their selection of new and pre-owned vehicles at stlouisacre.com and altontoyota.com. It's Mungenest,
[23:39.280 --> 23:43.600]  St. Louis Acre at Mungenest, Burghardt, Alton Toyota. That's Mungenest and if you're looking
[23:43.600 --> 23:49.120]  to place a couple wagers, whether it be this week or this weekend with the NFL coming up this weekend,
[23:49.120 --> 23:53.760]  we got three games on Christmas Day, including Ravens Niners on Christmas night. It's going to be
[22:25.580 --> 22:29.820]  He looked like he's blocking a 6'2", 280 pound guy and it looks like a five-year-old.
[22:29.820 --> 22:37.180]  Yeah, there's a guy I don't know if he was with Alabama or he's close to 400, maybe 410.
[22:37.180 --> 22:41.020]  And he's standing on the line next to a running back and this running back looked like a midget.
[22:41.020 --> 22:42.020]  That's what I'm saying.
[22:42.020 --> 22:44.500]  This guy and he had his shirt didn't fit.
[22:44.500 --> 22:50.820]  He had flab hanging everywhere and they show him running to make a tackle and stuff just
[22:50.820 --> 22:53.020]  flying everywhere.
[21:53.220 --> 21:54.980]  They're going to be at Fort Lauderdale Panthers.
[21:54.980 --> 21:56.100]  I like it in some cases.
[21:56.100 --> 21:58.500]  I wish the LA Angels would go back to the California Angels.
[21:58.500 --> 21:59.820]  We had the Missouri River Otters.
[21:59.820 --> 22:02.500]  You didn't support them, did you?
[22:02.500 --> 22:03.500]  What sport?
[22:03.500 --> 22:05.500]  Oh, Jackson.
[22:05.500 --> 22:06.500]  Hockey?
[22:06.500 --> 22:07.500]  That's right.
[22:07.500 --> 22:08.500]  Well, let's think.
[22:08.500 --> 22:12.860]  It would sound like an AHL team or a minor league team if you called it the Massachusetts
[22:12.860 --> 22:13.860]  Bruins.
[22:13.860 --> 22:14.860]  Yeah.
[22:14.860 --> 22:17.940]  So like St. Louis, it wouldn't ever be the case where Boston, because those are like
[22:17.940 --> 22:19.820]  major historical cities.
[22:19.820 --> 22:22.380]  Like from whatever you want to say about St. Louis, St. Louis has a major foothold in
[23:53.760 --> 23:57.840]  Saturday, Thursday, Monday, Sunday. They're filling it up. They're filling it up there.
[23:57.840 --> 24:01.200]  College hoops left and right. You get the bragging rights game, Friday, NHL,
[24:01.200 --> 24:04.800]  plenty of that coming up this week and this weekend. We got bowl games,
[24:04.800 --> 24:09.520]  plenty to wager on during the holidays. And you can do all of that with the world's largest
[24:09.520 --> 24:14.240]  sports book in Las Vegas. That is now in Illinois. That's right. The circus sports app is sports
[24:14.240 --> 24:18.640]  betting the way it should be with big app bets, high betting limits, tight money line splits,
[24:18.640 --> 24:22.160]  and the best customer service around. They're not going to start limiting you if you start
[22:54.020 --> 22:58.900]  When basketball nowadays, if you got a really tall kid that you think has a chance to make
[22:58.900 --> 23:04.580]  it, a lot of times in youth basketball, he'll be the one handling the ball.
[23:04.580 --> 23:07.780]  This is a guy that's got a chance to make it and even though we'd like to just set him
[23:07.780 --> 23:11.820]  under the basket to get rebound after rebound, we know that if he's going to climb the ladder,
[23:11.820 --> 23:13.300]  he's going to have to be able to handle the ball.
[23:13.300 --> 23:17.100]  That's why the Euro game, why you're seeing so many great European players come over here
[23:17.100 --> 23:20.500]  and be successful is because the way they teach the game over there is I don't care
[22:22.380 --> 22:23.380]  American history.
[22:23.380 --> 22:25.820]  Gateway to the West, a thousand different things.
[22:25.820 --> 22:27.820]  And there's two major cities in the state.
[22:27.820 --> 22:28.820]  In the state, right, exactly.
[22:28.820 --> 22:32.780]  Well, there's more than two major cities in Florida as well, but they don't play in either
[22:32.780 --> 22:34.260]  of them.
[22:34.260 --> 22:37.060]  However, for some situations, I think it's better.
[22:37.060 --> 22:38.700]  Like Boston, obviously not.
[22:38.700 --> 22:39.700]  New York, LA.
[22:39.700 --> 22:44.020]  Actually, with LA, I think the California Angels is better than the LA Angels.
[22:44.020 --> 22:45.620]  And bring back the halos on the hats.
[22:45.620 --> 22:46.620]  That I would like to see.
[22:46.620 --> 22:47.620]  You'd bring back the halos.
[22:47.620 --> 22:51.060]  But you have no choice in Minnesota, because you've got two major cities out there next
[22:51.060 --> 22:52.060]  to you.
[24:22.160 --> 24:25.600]  winning some really good money. A lot of some of these books, they're going to start saying,
[24:25.600 --> 24:29.520]  hey, you can't, you can't, you're going to limit you. That's not what circuit does. They want you
[24:29.520 --> 24:33.120]  to win. They want you to win. They got those tight money line splits and the best customer service
[24:33.120 --> 24:38.480]  around. The circus sports app is now available in Illinois. Visit circus sports.com for more details
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.240]  and get ready to start betting like a pro. If you or someone you know may have a problem with
[24:42.240 --> 24:51.280]  gambling, call 1-800-GAMBLER or text ILGAMB to 833-234. And Doug, we have a title sponsor and
[23:20.500 --> 23:25.340]  how tall you are, how short you are, you practice ball handling, shooting, like everyone
[23:25.340 --> 23:26.340]  else.
[23:26.340 --> 23:29.580]  And that's why some of these guys from Europe come over here and they're just as good as
[23:29.580 --> 23:31.740]  shooters as point guard, just as good as ball handlers.
[23:31.740 --> 23:35.660]  And now the American game is catching up to that because when I was a kid, if you were
[23:35.660 --> 23:37.620]  a big guy, all you did was work on big man moves.
[23:37.620 --> 23:38.620]  Right.
[23:38.620 --> 23:39.620]  It was more of a half court game.
[23:39.620 --> 23:42.380]  But what happens when you don't grow anymore after the eighth grade?
[23:42.380 --> 23:45.260]  It's like, well, now I have no skills for guard skills.
[23:45.260 --> 23:46.900]  A little bit of breaking Mizzou news.
[22:52.060 --> 22:54.900]  You should have the California Golden Seals.
[22:54.900 --> 22:55.900]  Yeah.
[22:55.900 --> 22:56.900]  Golden State Warriors.
[22:56.900 --> 22:57.900]  Carl Vadny.
[22:57.900 --> 22:58.900]  Utah Jazz.
[22:58.900 --> 22:59.900]  Yeah.
[22:59.900 --> 23:00.900]  I just like it.
[23:00.900 --> 23:01.900]  Indiana Pacers.
[23:01.900 --> 23:02.900]  I don't know.
[23:02.900 --> 23:03.900]  I just...
[23:03.900 --> 23:04.900]  Yeah, that's nice.
[23:04.900 --> 23:05.900]  But they also have the Indianapolis Colts.
[23:05.900 --> 23:09.100]  The World Series featured two teams where states were the...
[23:09.100 --> 23:10.900]  Yeah, Texas Rangers, Arizona Diamondbacks.
[23:10.900 --> 23:11.900]  Good on you.
[23:11.900 --> 23:12.900]  Good on you, KG.
[23:12.900 --> 23:13.900]  Very nice, KG.
[23:13.900 --> 23:14.900]  That's why you work here so often.
[23:14.900 --> 23:15.900]  Thank you, Doug.
[23:15.900 --> 23:20.340]  Yeah, because I guess most of those teams are based in Phoenix, but don't really play
[23:20.340 --> 23:21.340]  in Phoenix.
[24:51.280 --> 24:56.560]  they are Brown and Crouppen. We have Ed Herman on Tuesday. Great guy. Can you tell me a little bit
[24:56.560 --> 25:01.120]  about our title sponsor, Brown and Crouppen? Right. I don't know if they handle the type of
[25:01.120 --> 25:06.240]  law that Iggy's going to be involved in when he writes the book. He gets sued. Maybe he'll be
[25:06.240 --> 25:10.800]  facing Brown and Crouppen in the lawsuit in the courtroom. But they're certainly the guys you'd
[25:10.800 --> 25:15.600]  want on your side if you have any kind of personal injury case. Been around for a long, long time in
[25:15.600 --> 25:21.200]  St. Louis, founded in 1979, 44 years old now. And they've grown into one of the largest personal
[23:46.900 --> 23:52.980]  Miami linebacker Corey Flag Jr. is headed to the University of Missouri with linebackers
[23:52.980 --> 23:56.300]  Chad Bailey and Tyron Hopper both expected to leave after the season.
[23:56.300 --> 24:00.620]  They were in the market for him and Miami Florida transfer Corey Flag just announced
[24:00.620 --> 24:02.620]  that he'll finish his career at Mizzou.
[24:02.620 --> 24:04.540]  So there you go.
[24:04.540 --> 24:05.540]  Brothers coming too.
[24:05.540 --> 24:06.540]  His brother's coming as well?
[24:06.540 --> 24:07.540]  Yeah.
[24:07.540 --> 24:08.540]  Nice.
[24:08.540 --> 24:09.540]  More Portal.
[24:09.540 --> 24:10.540]  More Portal guys?
[24:10.540 --> 24:11.540]  Yes.
[24:11.540 --> 24:12.540]  Yes.
[24:12.540 --> 24:13.540]  This is a transfer portal.
[24:13.540 --> 24:16.180]  So he is coming to Missouri.
[23:21.580 --> 23:23.780]  I know the Cardinals playing Glendale.
[23:23.780 --> 23:24.780]  I don't know where that...
[23:24.780 --> 23:28.020]  I guess that little weak-ass stadium, the Coyotes play, is in Tempe, because it's a
[23:28.020 --> 23:29.020]  very, very...
[23:29.020 --> 23:30.420]  But the whole area is still Phoenix.
[23:30.420 --> 23:31.420]  Yeah, right.
[23:31.420 --> 23:34.860]  Even the Florida Panthers, that's still considered the Miami area.
[23:34.860 --> 23:36.940]  They used to play in downtown Miami.
[23:36.940 --> 23:37.940]  But it's Fort Lauderdale.
[23:37.940 --> 23:43.140]  But if the Cardinals or the Blues were to move to Maryland Heights, it'd still be St.
[23:43.140 --> 23:44.140]  Louis.
[23:44.140 --> 23:46.580]  Yeah, but that's different than Fort Lauderdale and the sunrise in Miami.
[23:46.580 --> 23:47.580]  Not a lot.
[23:47.580 --> 23:48.580]  Not a lot.
[25:21.200 --> 25:26.320]  injury firms in the Midwest. How'd they do that? Well, they deliver the results and they'll give
[25:26.320 --> 25:31.440]  you a free evaluation. They work on a contingency basis. No upfront cost to you. If you don't get
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.000]  paid, they don't get paid. And they've been paid a lot. They've won more than a billion dollars in
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.360]  compensation for their clients over the years. Brown and Crouppen is just the guys that you want
[25:41.360 --> 25:46.320]  in your corner. We've met Andy Crouppen and his father Terry and Ed Herman, as you said, has been
[24:16.180 --> 24:17.180]  There it is.
[24:17.180 --> 24:18.180]  Let's add another one.
[24:18.180 --> 24:19.180]  And how good a player is this guy?
[24:19.180 --> 24:22.660]  KG, I don't know if you've seen more on him.
[24:22.660 --> 24:23.660]  I'm just waiting for hours or so.
[24:23.660 --> 24:24.660]  No, I'll be honest.
[24:24.660 --> 24:25.660]  I don't know anything about him.
[24:25.660 --> 24:26.660]  Yeah.
[24:26.660 --> 24:30.540]  He's had 179 tackles, 24 and a half tackles for loss, five and a half sacks, and a forced
[24:30.540 --> 24:32.660]  fumble and interception is four years with Miami.
[24:32.660 --> 24:33.660]  So.
[24:33.660 --> 24:34.660]  I'll tell you what.
[24:34.660 --> 24:35.660]  I expect.
[24:35.660 --> 24:36.660]  Playing time.
[24:36.660 --> 24:37.660]  I expect a playoff appearance next year.
[24:37.660 --> 24:41.620]  I was asking Tim the other day saying, is it CFP or bust for Missouri next year?
[24:41.620 --> 24:42.620]  I really think so.
[24:42.620 --> 24:43.620]  It's crazy.
[23:49.020 --> 23:51.940]  Fort Lauderdale, Miami is 30 minutes away.
[23:51.940 --> 23:54.140]  Maryland Heights to downtown St. Louis, what, 25?
[23:54.140 --> 23:56.700]  Yeah, I'm not going to call it the Maryland Heights Blues.
[23:56.700 --> 23:57.700]  No.
[23:57.700 --> 23:58.700]  Yeah, but some people...
[23:58.700 --> 23:59.700]  I've said this before that...
[23:59.700 --> 24:01.460]  And I've always asked them this.
[24:01.460 --> 24:04.980]  It's just he's proud of the little city he's from.
[24:04.980 --> 24:08.980]  But Pete Weber, one of the most well-known bowlers of all time, whenever he'd make a
[24:08.980 --> 24:13.580]  TV show, it would always say, Pete Weber, St. Ann, Missouri.
[24:13.580 --> 24:14.580]  Never said St. Louis, Missouri.
[24:14.580 --> 24:15.580]  Always St. Ann, Missouri.
[24:15.580 --> 24:16.580]  Why do you do that?
[25:46.320 --> 25:51.200]  in many times. Great guys. You want to have them on your side. If you think you may need Brown and
[25:51.200 --> 25:58.720]  Crouppen services, call them. I'm going to go ahead and give that phone number now. 314-222-2222.
[25:58.720 --> 26:03.600]  Or you go to brownandcrouppen.com. Make sure to let them know you heard about it here on TMA. The
[26:03.600 --> 26:07.920]  choice of a lawyer is an important decision and should not be based solely on advertising. Past
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.400]  results are no guarantee of future results. And every case is different and must be judged on its
[24:43.860 --> 24:44.860]  Yeah.
[24:44.860 --> 24:49.540]  He, I, as much as I am gung ho on that as well, KG, Tim got brought up a good point
[24:49.540 --> 24:52.340]  where it's like, we just don't know what Auburn's going to look like next year.
[24:52.340 --> 24:55.340]  We don't know what Bama, what, you know, Oklahoma.
[24:55.340 --> 24:57.180]  It was just time last year.
[24:57.180 --> 24:59.060]  You had no idea that Mizzou was going to be like this.
[24:59.060 --> 25:00.060]  Right.
[25:00.060 --> 25:03.380]  If like, if it was there, if we're playing the schedule in 2024 based on 2023, then I
[25:03.380 --> 25:07.540]  would agree 11 one or 10 and two again would be what you'd strive for.
[25:07.540 --> 25:08.620]  But we just don't know what these teams.
[25:08.620 --> 25:11.420]  We were three or four games into this season and we didn't think Mizzou was going to be
[25:11.420 --> 25:12.420]  anything special.
[25:12.420 --> 25:13.420]  Yeah.
[26:12.400 --> 26:17.440]  own accord. I'll tell you one thing. If I get sued by some of these people and I show up in court
[26:17.440 --> 26:23.280]  and Brown and Crouppen is on their side, I'm in big trouble. You certainly are. Big time. Doug,
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.160]  we've gotten a couple texts here on the EDF Group text inbox asking you how was your first meeting
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.600]  with your grandson? Oh, it was fantastic. Yeah. Made it to the hospital twice yesterday, right after
[26:33.600 --> 26:37.600]  the show here. And they went back again later. Awesome. Took some pictures, held them. Are they
[24:16.580 --> 24:17.580]  That's where he lived.
[24:17.580 --> 24:19.580]  That's where his parents lived, St. Ann's.
[24:19.580 --> 24:20.580]  It's a tiny little suburb.
[24:20.580 --> 24:23.580]  I know, but he just says I'm from St. Ann, Missouri.
[24:23.580 --> 24:25.580]  And everyone had to say, where is that?
[24:25.580 --> 24:26.580]  Yeah.
[24:26.580 --> 24:27.580]  I was like, why don't you just say St. Louis?
[24:27.580 --> 24:28.580]  Because I'm not from St. Louis.
[24:28.580 --> 24:29.580]  I'm from St. Ann.
[24:29.580 --> 24:30.580]  I said, well, whatever.
[24:30.580 --> 24:33.980]  But when you travel out of St. Louis, you usually tell people you're from St. Louis,
[24:33.980 --> 24:34.980]  right?
[24:34.980 --> 24:35.980]  Yeah.
[24:35.980 --> 24:39.780]  I live in Sunset Hills, but when I'm doing my world traveling, I never say I'm from Sunset
[24:39.780 --> 24:40.780]  Hills, Missouri.
[24:40.780 --> 24:42.700]  It depends how far away you're going.
[24:42.700 --> 24:44.980]  Like if you're going somewhere, like if you were from...
[25:13.660 --> 25:14.660]  After that middle Tennessee game.
[25:14.660 --> 25:15.660]  Yeah.
[25:15.660 --> 25:19.420]  And the one they opened against South Dakota and that was just kind of so-so performance.
[25:19.420 --> 25:22.740]  We got to figure what the recruiting they're doing, the people are signing out of the portal.
[25:22.740 --> 25:26.300]  Like Jackson said, we don't know what the other other teams are going to do.
[25:26.300 --> 25:31.340]  But if you just go by, let's say you go into next year, like he did this year, they got
[25:31.340 --> 25:33.300]  to be one of the top 12 teams in the country.
[25:33.300 --> 25:34.300]  I think.
[25:34.300 --> 25:35.300]  Get right up there.
[25:35.300 --> 25:36.300]  That'll get you in.
[25:36.300 --> 25:37.300]  Probably so.
[25:37.300 --> 25:41.740]  They'll be ranked when the season starts this time or I'm sorry, in August of next year.
[26:37.600 --> 26:43.040]  back home yet? Cute little guy. No, takes a couple days. I saw a picture John posted. It looked like
[26:43.040 --> 26:47.440]  they were sitting on a couch at home. So there's a couch right there in the hospital room. The dad
[26:47.440 --> 26:53.520]  sleeps there. Yeah. Right. Oh man. It's all look good. All look healthy. Yeah, it's very healthy.
[26:53.520 --> 26:59.440]  Yeah. And it's a Gordy. Cute as a button. Yeah. Gordy. Gordon. I guess we'll call him Gordy.
[26:59.440 --> 27:03.840]  Like Gordy Howe. First time holding that grandson. Whenever we do sound stories, I always like to
[24:44.980 --> 24:46.980]  If you were in America, I'd say I'm from St. Louis.
[24:46.980 --> 24:47.980]  100%.
[24:47.980 --> 24:48.980]  100%.
[24:48.980 --> 24:49.980]  Yeah, I wouldn't know if I was from Maryland Heights.
[24:49.980 --> 24:50.980]  Well, you'd be from Brentwood.
[24:50.980 --> 24:51.980]  I'm from Brentwood.
[24:51.980 --> 24:52.980]  What?
[24:52.980 --> 24:53.980]  Brentwood, California?
[24:53.980 --> 24:57.980]  You know, right down the street from O.J.
[24:57.980 --> 25:01.980]  Yeah, but if like you were like in Union, Missouri, you'd say, and someone asked you
[25:01.980 --> 25:04.380]  back, yeah, I'm kind of from St. Louis, from the St. Louis area.
[25:04.380 --> 25:05.380]  Probably.
[25:05.380 --> 25:06.380]  You're not going to say Union.
[25:06.380 --> 25:08.380]  You'd say a small town outside of St. Louis.
[25:08.380 --> 25:09.380]  Right, right.
[25:09.380 --> 25:13.100]  It was the same people from Chicago if they're from like Naperville, which is by no means
[25:13.100 --> 25:14.580]  close to the city center.
[25:41.740 --> 25:45.820]  But doing a lot in the portal, man, you got to use that equity when you get there.
[25:45.820 --> 25:50.540]  You got to press while they are and it's hot and that is what the Missouri Tigers are doing.
[25:50.540 --> 25:54.340]  Do you think their success comes from Drinkwitz being able to drive that semi truck?
[25:54.340 --> 25:55.340]  Dump truck.
[25:55.340 --> 25:56.340]  Oh yeah.
[25:56.340 --> 25:57.340]  You drive that in the right areas.
[25:57.340 --> 26:01.100]  Jackson, if you had to bet, is Wiese going to be back or nah?
[26:01.100 --> 26:02.100]  I think so.
[26:02.100 --> 26:03.100]  I think so too.
[26:03.100 --> 26:06.700]  I think he didn't mean to leak that out on Luther's IG, but I think that's where his
[26:06.700 --> 26:07.700]  heart is.
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.160]  ask, like, what's that feeling like when you first get to get to hold the grandchild, you know,
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.480]  because I imagine that's just unbelievable feeling. Oh yeah. You forget how tiny they are when they're
[27:12.480 --> 27:16.800]  first born. Oh yeah. Like eight pounds. Just like next to nothing. I'm afraid to pick up my,
[27:17.360 --> 27:22.720]  whenever I have it and I've got 25 of them. So, um, but you get a new niece or nephew. I'm afraid
[27:22.720 --> 27:27.920]  to hold it because it's all you. I mean, you know, you know, if you let go of the head, it's just gonna
[27:27.920 --> 27:31.600]  support the head, support the neck and the head. Yeah, you gotta support it. So I always feel,
[25:14.580 --> 25:15.580]  You'd say you're from Chicago.
[25:15.580 --> 25:16.580]  Sure.
[25:16.580 --> 25:17.580]  I think it was a dam.
[25:17.580 --> 25:18.580]  Yes.
[25:18.580 --> 25:22.700]  My dogs go to daycare in St. Ann since we're talking about Pointless Anaktoa that comes
[25:22.700 --> 25:23.700]  from Mud Puppy.
[25:23.700 --> 25:24.700]  Do they really?
[25:24.700 --> 25:26.220]  What all is in St. Ann?
[25:26.220 --> 25:27.940]  They got a golf course, right?
[25:27.940 --> 25:28.940]  Yeah.
[25:28.940 --> 25:29.940]  They got anything else?
[25:29.940 --> 25:30.940]  Eggs?
[25:30.940 --> 25:32.940]  I don't think so.
[25:32.940 --> 25:33.940]  Is Chuckaburger there?
[25:33.940 --> 25:35.660]  The hell is Chuckaburger?
[25:35.660 --> 25:37.060]  We should probably look it up.
[25:37.060 --> 25:38.060]  Chuckaburger?
[25:38.060 --> 25:39.060]  Here we are.
[25:39.060 --> 25:40.060]  We're here.
[25:40.060 --> 25:41.060]  We're bowling in trophies in St. Ann, I think.
[25:41.060 --> 25:43.740]  Hey guys, why is the tight pale hate Matthew Kachuck?
[26:07.700 --> 26:12.180]  I think he had a really good year with just very little, you know, as a transfer, you
[26:12.180 --> 26:15.460]  know, it's like you're getting a ton of time to get used to a system or a quarterback.
[26:15.460 --> 26:19.660]  I think with another year like that, he has the ability to play in the NFL.
[26:19.660 --> 26:24.660]  And I think showcasing that for possibly a really good team in the SEC will be very beneficial
[26:24.660 --> 26:25.660]  to his future in football.
[26:25.660 --> 26:26.660]  I agree.
[26:26.660 --> 26:29.660]  I think that that would be the case.
[26:29.660 --> 26:33.980]  Chris Abrams-Drain and Dennis Raikstra, I would be surprised if they both came back.
[26:33.980 --> 26:35.380]  But one of them maybe, I don't know.
[26:35.380 --> 26:36.980]  Chris Abrams-Drain, neither of them declared.
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.400]  God, if I just, I hope I'm holding it right. You let the head flop around? No, but if you don't,
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.640]  it's going to. Yeah. Can't support itself. So you're holding it by the neck and kind of, then you start
[27:40.640 --> 27:47.760]  to, you want to give it back and it's like, you got it? You got it. I'm always just nervous. Well,
[27:47.760 --> 27:51.520]  Gordy is a Vaughn, so he's quite advanced. He's speaking a couple of languages already. Right.
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.360]  Right. Yeah. We hope to get him, you know, into five or six different languages. At least. Before
[27:55.360 --> 27:59.440]  he leaves the hospital. At least. And then into fusion, right? Over on the second or third birthday.
[25:43.740 --> 25:46.220]  It's from the River de Parri Yacht Captain.
[25:46.220 --> 25:48.260]  Oh, hey, Matthew Kachuck.
[25:48.260 --> 25:52.220]  Big fan of all St. Louis area athletes rooting for him, baby.
[25:52.220 --> 25:53.220]  Oh, yeah?
[25:53.220 --> 25:54.740]  Yeah, Northwest Plaza was in St. Ann.
[25:54.740 --> 25:55.740]  That's where Manupa eligible.
[25:55.740 --> 25:56.740]  Was that St. Ann?
[25:56.740 --> 25:57.740]  That's where Manupa eligible claims.
[25:57.740 --> 26:00.620]  How about any guess on the population of St. Ann?
[26:00.620 --> 26:03.500]  I'm going to say 12,000.
[26:03.500 --> 26:05.140]  I'll go 14.
[26:05.140 --> 26:07.540]  22, I'm guessing.
[26:07.540 --> 26:08.540]  Nine.
[26:08.540 --> 26:09.540]  13,019.
[26:09.540 --> 26:10.540]  Who's flooded, eggs?
[26:10.540 --> 26:11.540]  As of 2020.
[26:11.540 --> 26:12.540]  I looked it up.
[27:59.440 --> 28:04.240]  We're hoping. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Time to start, time to earn your keep, boy. Well, that's right.
[28:04.240 --> 28:07.440]  You know, the hospital mom's in a wheelchair and the baby's like walking next to her.
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.680]  Come on, mom. Hurry up. Congratulations to the entire Vaughn family. John Vaughn, his wife,
[28:13.680 --> 28:18.560]  you and your lovely wife. Yeah, that's exciting. It's a fun time. It's absolutely awesome. Very,
[28:18.560 --> 28:24.720]  very cool. Hey boys, PLTD yesterday's show. Iggy doesn't need to find the sugar mama. He just needs
[26:37.740 --> 26:39.740]  Does Wiese know where he'd go in the draft?
[26:39.740 --> 26:41.500]  Has anybody told him where he'd go in the draft?
[26:41.500 --> 26:42.500]  I have no idea.
[26:42.500 --> 26:43.500]  I haven't heard anything.
[26:43.500 --> 26:44.500]  I have no idea.
[26:44.500 --> 26:47.140]  The mock drafts are only usually the first couple of rounds and he's certainly not in
[26:47.140 --> 26:48.140]  any of those.
[26:48.140 --> 26:50.260]  Does Schrader show up in any mock drafts?
[26:50.260 --> 26:51.260]  I can't imagine.
[26:51.260 --> 26:54.300]  He signs me as a big time undrafted free agent.
[26:54.300 --> 26:56.220]  Like a guy you'd sign practice squad maybe.
[26:56.220 --> 26:58.340]  What do you have to do as a running back to get drafted?
[26:58.340 --> 26:59.340]  Be taller.
[26:59.340 --> 27:00.340]  Taller and faster.
[27:00.340 --> 27:01.860]  A lot of them in the NFL aren't tall.
[27:01.860 --> 27:02.860]  But they're fast.
[27:02.860 --> 27:03.860]  Like really fast.
[27:03.860 --> 27:05.140]  They are fast, but I mean, he's quick.
[27:05.140 --> 27:06.140]  He's quick.
[26:12.540 --> 26:13.540]  I wasn't.
[26:13.540 --> 26:18.460]  You know who was here for the grand opening of Northwest Plaza?
[26:18.460 --> 26:19.460]  Can we have initials?
[26:19.460 --> 26:20.460]  Yeah, I like to play guessing.
[26:20.460 --> 26:21.460]  JFK.
[26:21.460 --> 26:22.460]  John F. Kennedy.
[26:22.460 --> 26:23.460]  Yeah.
[26:23.460 --> 26:24.460]  Good one, Doug.
[26:24.460 --> 26:25.460]  Nailed it.
[26:25.460 --> 26:27.060]  At the time, I believe it was like the largest mall in the country.
[26:27.060 --> 26:28.220]  At least that's how they build it.
[26:28.220 --> 26:29.220]  Yeah.
[26:29.220 --> 26:33.420]  I don't think he was here to cut a ribbon, but he was here speaking and he spoke when
[26:33.420 --> 26:36.020]  it first opened in the parking lot of Northwest Plaza.
[26:36.020 --> 26:40.100]  My parents took me to see him at Crestwood Plaza when I was just a wee, but a wee little
[26:40.100 --> 26:41.100]  lad.
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.400]  to publish that book. Viva La Strode. That's from the A-town dropout. It could be the answer to all
[28:30.400 --> 28:34.160]  your financial woes. Yeah. That's your golden parachutes, this book. That could be on the
[28:34.160 --> 28:39.680]  New York Times bestseller list. And then you sell the film rights. That's the move. You know, you
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.880]  pay to get on that list. You get on the bestseller list? Allegedly. Yeah, I don't doubt it. No, I don't
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.960]  know. You do. You pay to get on that list. What's it cost? I don't know. Still. But you see some of
[28:48.960 --> 28:53.600]  these people you never heard around the bestseller and they just pay. Well, that's probably a
[27:06.140 --> 27:07.140]  He doesn't have that breakaway speed.
[27:07.140 --> 27:08.140]  That's the thing on him.
[27:08.140 --> 27:11.340]  How many running backs do you see going 70 yards for touchdowns nowadays?
[27:11.340 --> 27:13.500]  Does it ever happen?
[27:13.500 --> 27:16.780]  Another great equalizer is the ability to catch.
[27:16.780 --> 27:17.780]  Pass catching.
[27:17.780 --> 27:18.940]  Christian McCaffrey is not the only one at the best running back.
[27:18.940 --> 27:21.460]  He's also the best pass catching running back.
[27:21.460 --> 27:24.380]  And that's so dangerous in an offense.
[27:24.380 --> 27:25.380]  That's not Schrader's fault.
[27:25.380 --> 27:27.860]  Missouri didn't run a ton of passing plays for him.
[27:27.860 --> 27:31.620]  But I'm sure he has the ability to go out and catch.
[27:31.620 --> 27:34.420]  That's a great way to equalize not having breakaway speed.
[27:34.420 --> 27:35.900]  It's being really effective in the pass game.
[26:41.100 --> 26:42.100]  That was a small tour.
[26:42.100 --> 26:43.100]  Yeah.
[26:43.100 --> 26:45.340]  That's a tour you want to be at, baby.
[26:45.340 --> 26:46.740]  Those were the happened places back then.
[26:46.740 --> 26:49.460]  Then again, maybe it was Crestwood and it was a Northwest Plaza, I'm thinking of.
[26:49.460 --> 26:50.460]  I don't know if it was Crestwood.
[26:50.460 --> 26:52.780]  I don't know if he was here for two mall openings.
[26:52.780 --> 26:53.780]  Good Crestwood.
[26:53.780 --> 26:57.140]  I'm shocked by how many texts I've seen of this, but a bunch of people are saying Chuck
[26:57.140 --> 26:58.580]  Bergers and St. John's.
[26:58.580 --> 27:00.380]  I started my teaching career right across.
[27:00.380 --> 27:02.060]  I should have known that.
[27:02.060 --> 27:03.060]  At?
[27:03.060 --> 27:04.060]  The?
[27:04.060 --> 27:05.060]  Rittner?
[27:05.060 --> 27:07.780]  Yeah, I was going to say, I didn't know if you wanted me to release info, but I guess,
[27:07.780 --> 27:08.780]  Rittner.
[28:54.720 --> 29:01.840]  for them. It's probably worth the money. I'm a mark. I see that it says instant New York Times
[29:01.840 --> 29:06.960]  bestseller. I buy it immediately. National Academy Awards, whatever. Well, I mean, there's
[29:06.960 --> 29:10.880]  a glad handing going on around there, but I wouldn't say they're paying for it. Well,
[29:10.880 --> 29:14.640]  whatever studio spends the most money on promoting a film and getting it out there and
[29:14.640 --> 29:18.960]  schmoozing the voters. Schmoozing the voters. When your book gets made into a movie, who will
[29:18.960 --> 29:22.400]  play the lead role of Iggy? Yeah, that's the real question right there. There's going to be a lot of
[27:36.660 --> 27:38.660]  I would say somebody takes a chance on him in the seventh run.
[27:38.660 --> 27:39.660]  Maybe.
[27:39.660 --> 27:40.660]  I hope so.
[27:40.660 --> 27:41.660]  I hope so.
[27:41.660 --> 27:42.660]  He's an incredible story.
[27:42.660 --> 27:44.660]  St. Louis guy obviously, but such a hard worker man.
[27:44.660 --> 27:47.500]  You think Cook's got a chance to play at the next level here in the next couple years?
[27:47.500 --> 27:49.260]  He has another year like he did this year.
[27:49.260 --> 27:50.260]  Why not?
[27:50.260 --> 27:51.260]  I love him.
[27:51.260 --> 27:53.700]  I just don't.
[27:53.700 --> 27:57.380]  I can't get enough of what he's gone through when he's done playing through injury, but
[27:57.380 --> 27:58.860]  that's consistent enough for me.
[27:58.860 --> 28:02.820]  But then again, I guess if you do look at the NFL and see who has started games the
[28:02.820 --> 28:03.820]  last few years.
[28:03.820 --> 28:05.100]  Look at the starters for this week.
[27:08.780 --> 27:14.540]  When you're on 170 on your way to Normandy Golf Course driving north, there's that one
[27:14.540 --> 27:19.500]  little stretch where it says, oh, you're in Charlacc, and then you drive about 50 yards
[27:19.500 --> 27:20.780]  and it says, now you're in another town.
[27:20.780 --> 27:21.780]  Sycamore Hills.
[27:21.780 --> 27:22.780]  Yeah.
[27:22.780 --> 27:25.620]  And then a little while later, another bit, you're in Normandy.
[27:25.620 --> 27:28.300]  You could throw a baseball between the three meters.
[27:28.300 --> 27:29.300]  Charlacc.
[27:29.300 --> 27:30.300]  Yeah.
[27:30.300 --> 27:31.300]  Yeah.
[27:31.300 --> 27:32.300]  I guess, yeah, is Normandy at what, Belnour?
[27:32.300 --> 27:34.300]  Is that the municipalities then?
[27:34.300 --> 27:35.300]  Yeah.
[27:35.300 --> 27:36.300]  It can get confusing on the north side.
[27:36.300 --> 27:37.900]  It can really get stupid up there.
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.880]  texts coming in for that short lady. That was a, I can't remember her name. Linda Hunt.
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.040]  Linda Hunt. There's going to be about a hundred texts coming in here on the EDF Group text inbox.
[29:31.040 --> 29:36.800]  It's Linda Hunt, but that's not who you would choose. No, I'd probably, I'd probably go
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.600]  Jonathan Rees-Myers. Jonathan Rees-Myers. I don't believe I know him. Does he pop you
[29:41.600 --> 29:46.880]  on the floppy disk era? No, he's one of my favorite actors. Good looking dude. Great actor. He was in
[29:46.880 --> 29:50.640]  the tutors is one of my favorites, which I'm rewatching by the way. Doug, do you think that
[28:05.180 --> 28:07.740]  I guess it wouldn't be surprising that he would get a chance.
[28:07.740 --> 28:09.380]  He's got a couple things going for him.
[28:09.380 --> 28:10.700]  He's a big guy for quarterback.
[28:10.700 --> 28:11.700]  He's tough as nails.
[28:11.700 --> 28:14.980]  He's a good runner and he's got arm strength.
[28:14.980 --> 28:17.540]  He's got all the physical tools that you would want.
[28:17.540 --> 28:20.620]  At this time last year, nobody thought he could throw the deep ball and he kind of silenced
[28:20.620 --> 28:23.100]  that a little bit in another year of progression.
[28:23.100 --> 28:25.340]  I think he could find himself in the league.
[28:25.340 --> 28:26.340]  Sure.
[28:26.340 --> 28:28.780]  Just another year like he had last year.
[28:28.780 --> 28:32.700]  Get away of some of the mistakes, like the little mistakes.
[29:50.640 --> 29:55.440]  looks like Iggy? Oh yeah, that's exactly like you. What picture you showing? This one with the little,
[29:57.760 --> 30:02.240]  oh yeah, 30 years younger than you. Well, I guess he would play you. Well, I'm not going to be playing
[30:02.240 --> 30:07.920]  myself when I'm 90. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I could see that. Um, and I don't know if, I don't think
[30:07.920 --> 30:12.240]  we have a clip of it anywhere because I don't even think the interview is anywhere. Uh, maybe
[30:12.240 --> 30:19.360]  Swope can find it. But, uh, Leah Remini said she would play my love interest if we make out.
[27:38.540 --> 27:40.900]  At least in south count, at least the areas are big.
[27:40.900 --> 27:41.900]  Huge.
[27:41.900 --> 27:42.900]  Kirkwood's got almost 30,000 wildwood.
[27:42.900 --> 27:43.900]  Wildwood?
[27:43.900 --> 27:44.900]  There's probably 20,000, yeah.
[27:44.900 --> 27:45.900]  Chesterfield, huge.
[27:45.900 --> 27:47.900]  We need a few more municipalities.
[27:47.900 --> 27:48.900]  Yeah.
[27:48.900 --> 27:49.900]  I think 10 more should do it.
[27:49.900 --> 27:52.140]  North counties where it really just gets stupid.
[27:52.140 --> 27:53.660]  There's tiny little places up there.
[27:53.660 --> 27:54.660]  They're tiniest.
[27:54.660 --> 27:55.660]  Yeah.
[27:55.660 --> 27:57.260]  I wonder who's in charge of naming these places.
[27:57.260 --> 27:58.260]  People have founded them.
[27:58.260 --> 27:59.260]  Yeah.
[27:59.260 --> 28:01.260]  They've been there 100 years probably, or more, most of them.
[28:01.260 --> 28:03.260]  Let's call this Charlacc.
[28:03.260 --> 28:06.380]  Let's call this Belnour.
[28:32.700 --> 28:37.420]  Everyone's going to think of Georgia or the LSU pick.
[28:37.420 --> 28:40.780]  You can use your legs like he did and also have trust in your arm to go deep.
[28:40.780 --> 28:41.780]  That's a fair amount.
[28:41.780 --> 28:44.140]  That's kind of the way the quarterback position has trended.
[28:44.140 --> 28:47.980]  The quarterback draw is such a lethal play and Missouri ran it like crazy.
[28:47.980 --> 28:51.020]  Every time they were in the red zone last year, it was like some sort of quarterback
[28:51.020 --> 28:52.900]  draw from what you'd cook to get in there.
[28:52.900 --> 28:56.300]  I just wish he would use a different mouthpiece.
[28:56.300 --> 28:57.580]  I beg your pardon, sir.
[28:57.580 --> 28:59.540]  He looks like a Hoosier.
[28:59.540 --> 29:01.540]  He looks like he's missing about five teeth.
[30:19.920 --> 30:25.040]  And I said, I'll be making out. She goes, I'm in. Yeah. What's, you have to cast it with only
[30:25.040 --> 30:28.240]  people who have been on straight to the web. That's, that's the only people you could do.
[30:28.880 --> 30:32.800]  We could do that. Yeah. It's a shame Marty Feldman's no longer with us because he's
[30:32.800 --> 30:37.760]  been a good one to play you when you're in it. What's that? That's John Lithgow.
[30:37.760 --> 30:44.720]  Um, yeah, go find that Swope. I'd love to hear that part where she said that to me.
[28:06.380 --> 28:09.660]  Kirkwood was named after James Kirkwood, the engineer who laid it out.
[28:09.660 --> 28:10.660]  Nice.
[28:10.660 --> 28:13.380]  And who's in charge of naming streets?
[28:13.380 --> 28:14.380]  City Planner.
[28:14.380 --> 28:17.220]  You would think you'd run out of names after a while.
[28:17.220 --> 28:19.220]  Kirkwood won't win presidents.
[28:19.220 --> 28:20.220]  Yeah.
[28:20.220 --> 28:21.220]  Always, yeah.
[28:21.220 --> 28:22.300]  I mean, there's the estate street.
[28:22.300 --> 28:23.620]  There's same streets in there.
[28:23.620 --> 28:27.020]  Like Columbia is downtown Columbia.
[28:27.020 --> 28:30.980]  I have streets that run north to south are numbered.
[28:30.980 --> 28:32.980]  Streets that run east to west are tree names.
[28:32.980 --> 28:33.980]  Yeah.
[28:33.980 --> 28:34.980]  Cherry.
[29:01.580 --> 29:04.900]  I don't understand these guys that wear a mouthpiece and then have a second one
[29:04.900 --> 29:05.900]  hanging from the helmet.
[29:07.100 --> 29:08.940]  The first one gets knocked out, I guess.
[29:08.940 --> 29:12.460]  Now you see all these quarterbacks now are chewing on him like Mahomes does.
[29:13.780 --> 29:18.260]  Steph, Steph is the the king of chewing on and unfortunately throwing his
[29:18.260 --> 29:19.260]  mouthpiece.
[29:19.540 --> 29:22.660]  All these crazy alien stories can't be true, can they?
[29:22.660 --> 29:25.820]  Hey, Stephen Deener hosted the Unidentified Alien podcast.
[29:25.820 --> 29:29.060]  And whether you're new to the conversation or have been looking into it for years,
[30:45.440 --> 30:50.320]  Leah Remini said she wanted to make out. Uh, with you. Yeah. Someone said William H. Macy.
[30:50.320 --> 30:53.440]  Actually, I think that would be good. That was my first thought as well. Well, he's in town,
[30:53.440 --> 30:58.480]  so let's go ahead and call it. Yeah. We can book that up. Back in the day when I had a different
[30:58.480 --> 31:03.040]  hairstyle, it wasn't spike spike. It was kind of short and kind of before the cut and color. I
[31:03.040 --> 31:09.440]  flew it all over the place. Um, people said I had a little Kevin Bacon going on. A lot of people
[31:09.440 --> 31:14.560]  said that. A lot of people said you look like Kevin Bacon. So maybe Kevin Bacon in my earlier days.
[28:34.980 --> 28:37.020]  First person to have a name.
[28:37.020 --> 28:38.020]  Now you're getting something.
[28:38.020 --> 28:39.020]  Adam, I guess.
[28:39.020 --> 28:40.020]  Now you're getting somewhere.
[28:40.020 --> 28:42.220]  And then last names.
[28:42.220 --> 28:43.220]  Surnames?
[28:43.220 --> 28:44.220]  Yeah.
[28:44.220 --> 28:45.220]  Who came up with that?
[28:45.220 --> 28:46.420]  Like somebody was born and your name was Bob.
[28:46.420 --> 28:48.740]  I think they were based on professions.
[28:48.740 --> 28:49.740]  That's what they say, Smith.
[28:49.740 --> 28:50.740]  For the most part, yeah.
[28:50.740 --> 28:52.300]  But who came up with the idea?
[28:52.300 --> 28:53.620]  We need a last name.
[28:53.620 --> 28:57.900]  Well, when they got to have a lot of people, they needed a better way to identify.
[28:57.900 --> 28:58.900]  All the bills were getting confused.
[28:58.900 --> 29:00.500]  It was the first person to do that.
[29:00.500 --> 29:02.540]  It was the first person to say, we're going to give ourselves a last name.
[29:02.540 --> 29:04.540]  We'll call ourselves Johnson.
[29:29.060 --> 29:32.780]  you need to check out the fastest growing alien show out there, the Unidentified
[29:32.780 --> 29:35.140]  Alien podcast or UAP for short.
[29:35.140 --> 29:38.940]  There's a crazy amount of alien encounter stories out there from all over the world.
[29:38.940 --> 29:42.460]  And the beauty of it is that I bring them all to you and that you decide what you
[29:42.460 --> 29:46.620]  believe. Download and subscribe to UAP on any of the major podcasting platforms.
[29:46.620 --> 29:49.580]  And you can also find it on UAP Podcast dot com.
[29:50.620 --> 29:53.340]  Mark Cannon won't throw a mouthpiece at you, though, when you're working with them.
[29:53.340 --> 29:54.180]  That's not what he'll do.
[29:54.180 --> 29:55.220]  It's not been my experience.
[29:55.220 --> 29:55.820]  That's not what he'll do.
[29:55.820 --> 29:59.020]  You go in and ask about your 401K and you get a mouthpiece thrown at you.
[31:14.880 --> 31:22.000]  Yeah. You know, I can actually, I can see that. He's 65 now. Yeah. Yeah. But we gotta get somebody
[31:22.000 --> 31:27.760]  through the 30s, somebody who's kind of buff and buff. Yeah. Glistening in the sun. I think Ken's
[31:27.760 --> 31:33.760]  throat, I think was buff. But again, if we've never been buff, but again, if we're doing it,
[31:34.640 --> 31:40.000]  if we're doing it just on the radio career, then Bermuda wouldn't come into it. All the women I
[29:05.100 --> 29:07.100]  It was long before the printed press or anything.
[29:07.100 --> 29:10.420]  So probably no one will ever know who the first person was who came up with that idea.
[29:10.420 --> 29:11.420]  I'd like to know.
[29:11.420 --> 29:15.100]  These are questions you should ask when you were a kid.
[29:15.100 --> 29:17.100]  That's from Jonathan Tisworthy.
[29:17.100 --> 29:19.980]  Moses didn't really have a last name, did he?
[29:19.980 --> 29:20.980]  Cole Jesus?
[29:20.980 --> 29:24.380]  Speaking of which, Darnell Cole's name, Kriv Kor.
[29:24.380 --> 29:25.780]  Yeah, they didn't have it.
[29:25.780 --> 29:27.780]  But who was the first person who said, you know what?
[29:27.780 --> 29:30.580]  Hey, you're just calling me Joshua.
[29:30.580 --> 29:32.140]  I want a last name.
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.720]  slept with in my twenties and thirties aren't going to come into it. Um, it would just be radio.
[31:44.720 --> 31:50.800]  I don't know. A radio persona and the bad boy from Bermuda. Yeah. I don't know how I do it.
[31:50.800 --> 31:55.280]  I think it'd be a fun movie. I don't know. What's the, what's the kicker to it all? Where does it,
[31:55.280 --> 32:00.960]  where does it lead to? I don't know. Is it halfway through the movie to where you move into your
[32:00.960 --> 32:08.000]  third apartment in the same complex? Yeah, that'll be in there then. Maybe it ends with me just
[29:59.020 --> 30:00.020]  That's not what happens.
[30:00.020 --> 30:00.820]  Can I hear a little bit?
[30:00.820 --> 30:01.340]  Yeah.
[30:01.340 --> 30:03.460]  The one we have is of you talking about Mark.
[30:03.460 --> 30:04.620]  Oh, so I'll just do it.
[30:04.620 --> 30:07.100]  So I assume that you could do it live.
[30:07.100 --> 30:07.940]  Well, do it live.
[30:07.940 --> 30:08.460]  I like this.
[30:08.460 --> 30:09.300]  Riley.
[30:09.300 --> 30:10.100]  Mark Cannon.
[30:10.100 --> 30:11.740]  Man, I love working with Mark Cannon.
[30:11.740 --> 30:12.260]  For real.
[30:12.260 --> 30:13.260]  Like him.
[30:13.260 --> 30:13.980]  He's the best.
[30:13.980 --> 30:16.700]  Yeah, having someone like him in your corner is so important.
[30:16.700 --> 30:17.260]  He'll tell you.
[30:17.260 --> 30:18.260]  He'll be the one to tell you.
[30:18.260 --> 30:19.300]  Like, it doesn't matter if it's me.
[30:19.300 --> 30:20.460]  Like, I want it to be me.
[30:20.460 --> 30:22.260]  But get a financial advisor.
[30:22.260 --> 30:26.460]  Get somebody in your corner because you might think that you have all the answers
[30:26.460 --> 30:28.300]  to these things or that, you know, whatever.
[29:32.140 --> 29:34.620]  I'm going to call myself.
[29:34.620 --> 29:36.140]  And then everybody started doing that.
[29:36.140 --> 29:39.020]  Everybody started to come up with a last name, naming themselves.
[29:39.020 --> 29:40.020]  Probably.
[29:40.020 --> 29:42.540]  Now, Caesar Augustus, was that his last name?
[29:42.540 --> 29:45.620]  No, it was Augustus Caesar, wasn't it?
[29:45.620 --> 29:48.020]  Augustus and Julius Caesar.
[29:48.020 --> 29:49.020]  Octavian.
[29:49.020 --> 29:50.540]  Yeah, they're all Augustus.
[29:50.540 --> 29:52.220]  Is his last name Caesar?
[29:52.220 --> 29:53.220]  I don't know.
[29:53.220 --> 29:54.220]  Yeah.
[29:54.220 --> 29:55.820]  Well, I think Caesar is a title.
[29:55.820 --> 29:56.820]  Caesar was a title.
[29:56.820 --> 29:58.980]  They all had last names.
[29:58.980 --> 30:00.140]  But Caesar is a title, right?
[30:00.140 --> 30:01.140]  It's not their name.
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.680]  living on the streets, running out of money and just. So is the documentary. Yeah.
[32:12.240 --> 32:16.880]  Not like a Sundance film. It's not a biography. But then when it hits, then you're, then you're
[32:16.880 --> 32:23.600]  moving into Calabasas. Yeah. I go with, uh, I go through all these women and places I've visited
[32:23.600 --> 32:30.320]  and places I've lived and made no money to the end where I've run out of my social security and
[32:30.320 --> 32:37.040]  I'm still alive and I'm just living on the street. If you want this job, it's not hard to get. Right.
[30:28.300 --> 30:29.260]  My friends do this.
[30:29.260 --> 30:30.220]  I'll just do the same thing.
[30:30.220 --> 30:31.100]  That's not the case.
[30:31.100 --> 30:32.460]  Get somebody in your corner.
[30:32.460 --> 30:34.300]  You're going to be so happy that you did.
[30:34.300 --> 30:35.900]  You're going to be in such a better position.
[30:35.900 --> 30:39.780]  I couldn't think of a better way to start 2024 than getting a conversation
[30:39.780 --> 30:43.100]  going with Mark Cannon, letting him make a custom plan for you,
[30:43.100 --> 30:46.660]  one that works best for you and your future and your family's future.
[30:46.660 --> 30:48.300]  And if you have to make adjustments on the road,
[30:48.300 --> 30:50.260]  you can always get on the phone with Mark Cannon.
[30:50.260 --> 30:54.140]  I implore our listeners to start off 2024 right
[30:54.140 --> 30:57.700]  and work with Mark Cannon of Evergreen Wealth Strategies
[30:02.140 --> 30:03.140]  Now we're getting somewhere, baby.
[30:03.140 --> 30:04.140]  Yes.
[30:04.140 --> 30:05.140]  Somebody get out the Google machine.
[30:05.140 --> 30:06.140]  Now we're getting something.
[30:06.140 --> 30:07.140]  You need to get this in the skeleton ASAP.
[30:07.140 --> 30:08.140]  Yeah, I like it.
[30:08.140 --> 30:10.140]  Who had the first last name?
[30:10.140 --> 30:11.140]  That's the question.
[30:11.140 --> 30:12.140]  And who came up with it?
[30:12.140 --> 30:13.980]  I bet you it's Smith.
[30:13.980 --> 30:15.300]  And some of these names you can't even pronounce.
[30:15.300 --> 30:16.300]  Who would come up with that name?
[30:16.300 --> 30:18.820]  Yeah, why do they call it surname instead of last name?
[30:18.820 --> 30:21.820]  Yeah, did Jesus Christ name himself?
[30:21.820 --> 30:22.820]  Or did?
[30:22.820 --> 30:23.820]  His parents would have named him.
[30:23.820 --> 30:26.380]  Yeah, but is it God Christ then?
[30:26.380 --> 30:27.380]  Oh, Jesus.
[30:27.380 --> 30:29.980]  Yeah, but God's Jesus' dad, right?
[30:29.980 --> 30:30.980]  God is his father.
[30:57.700 --> 30:59.220]  and Plowhawk James Carlton.
[30:59.220 --> 31:01.140]  He's your guy, a great guy.
[31:01.140 --> 31:05.140]  A true son himself is probably fired up about this Miami-Yam backer transfer.
[31:05.140 --> 31:06.700]  Can I hear a little about James Carlton?
[31:06.700 --> 31:12.100]  James Carlton of the Carlton State Farm Insurance Agency in Webster Groves
[31:12.100 --> 31:13.860]  is my insurance agent.
[31:13.860 --> 31:16.220]  He's the Plowhawk's insurance agent.
[31:16.220 --> 31:20.620]  And I would love for him to become your insurance agent as well.
[31:20.620 --> 31:24.340]  And there is a reason I say that because I have learned that there is a difference
[32:37.040 --> 32:40.800]  There I am. Yeah. Begging for change. Maybe that's the title. I mean, listen,
[32:40.800 --> 32:44.880]  these streaming services, they'll put out damn near anything it looks like. So.
[32:44.880 --> 32:47.680]  Right. They produce it. It'll get out there somewhere. Yeah. You just got to get involved
[32:47.680 --> 32:51.360]  with the right people. And next thing you know, you're, you're a star. I know people in the
[32:51.360 --> 32:55.920]  industry, you know, reach out to W. O. Brown, maybe John Ashton. Big tough, collect your winnings
[32:55.920 --> 33:01.840]  because he sexted in three minutes ago, John Ashton and W. O. Brown. Well, those are the
[30:31.820 --> 30:32.820]  God, sham God.
[30:32.820 --> 30:33.820]  Really nice dribble move he invented.
[30:33.820 --> 30:35.820]  But you see some of these last names you can't even pronounce.
[30:35.820 --> 30:36.820]  So God Christ, that's the first last name.
[30:36.820 --> 30:38.820]  That would be Christ because...
[30:38.820 --> 30:41.140]  But some names you can't even pronounce the last name.
[30:41.140 --> 30:42.140]  Who would come up with that?
[30:42.140 --> 30:44.140]  When you think you can come up with a name people can pronounce?
[30:44.140 --> 30:45.140]  Well, we might have to go with that.
[30:45.140 --> 30:46.140]  John Laquiditatia.
[30:46.140 --> 30:48.140]  Well, because we speak English.
[30:48.140 --> 30:49.140]  Trees Laquica.
[30:49.140 --> 30:52.260]  There's other languages outside of English.
[30:52.260 --> 30:54.540]  But somebody had to name that name first.
[30:54.540 --> 30:56.980]  I bet they could pronounce it in their native tongue.
[30:56.980 --> 30:57.980]  Well.
[30:57.980 --> 30:58.980]  Huh.
[31:24.340 --> 31:27.420]  between what James Carlton and his staff do
[31:27.420 --> 31:29.940]  and a lot of other insurance agencies.
[31:29.940 --> 31:35.980]  And that is putting customer service at the absolute top of the list of priorities.
[31:35.980 --> 31:42.300]  And now that's why they have 339 five-star reviews
[31:42.300 --> 31:46.500]  when you search James Carlton and the Carlton State Farm Insurance Agency on Google.
[31:46.500 --> 31:49.940]  This one posted just a week ago, recently switched to James,
[31:49.940 --> 31:53.060]  and he set up a meeting with me instantly to go over my coverage during our meeting.
[33:01.840 --> 33:07.600]  people I know. Your account has been credited, big tuft. Um, OMG tip come home. The crispy Kevin
[33:07.600 --> 33:12.480]  Bacon has taken over. It's from the six three six sink vomit scene and then cut to black like the
[33:12.480 --> 33:19.280]  Sopranos. That's from Carlos spicy. That's how it ends. I'd have to think. Yeah. Yeah. Again,
[33:19.280 --> 33:24.800]  well, that's during my radio career. So I guess I could get in there. I don't know. No, I don't
[33:24.800 --> 33:30.320]  know that that's, that's a whole lot more unique than what other people experience at any time
[31:53.060 --> 31:58.180]  James informed us of the drive and save discount, which I was never even aware of before.
[31:58.180 --> 32:01.180]  We went over the rest of my coverage in extensive detail,
[32:01.180 --> 32:03.740]  which I had never had an agent do before.
[32:03.740 --> 32:07.140]  Very happy with my decision to switch to James Carlton.
[32:07.140 --> 32:13.500]  As am I, that posted on Google, and it's one of 339 five-star reviews.
[32:13.500 --> 32:17.300]  The number for James Carlton's agency, 314-961-4800,
[32:17.300 --> 32:19.380]  or go online at CarltonInsurance.net.
[30:59.980 --> 31:03.980]  Like some American names are probably very tough for someone who speaks like Japanese.
[31:03.980 --> 31:04.980]  Trees Laquica.
[31:04.980 --> 31:05.980]  Bingo.
[31:05.980 --> 31:06.980]  Yeah, you couldn't pronounce that last name.
[31:06.980 --> 31:09.980]  Yeah, there's just certain things I think I was thinking about that the other day.
[31:09.980 --> 31:13.980]  I saw a last name that I said, my God, wouldn't you shorten that?
[31:13.980 --> 31:14.980]  Who came up with that?
[31:14.980 --> 31:15.980]  You can't even pronounce it first.
[31:15.980 --> 31:17.980]  Well, I'll give you some information.
[31:17.980 --> 31:21.980]  Family names appear to have developed first in China originally among the nobility and
[31:21.980 --> 31:22.980]  then spread to commoners.
[33:30.400 --> 33:36.160]  during their life. Some drunken episode after the bars or something. Having a threesome and
[33:36.160 --> 33:39.600]  having somebody throw up in your sink. It's probably happened to a lot of people. A lot of
[33:39.600 --> 33:44.880]  people. Having people throw up in their sink. Sure. I throw up in the toilet. You slept with
[33:44.880 --> 33:50.880]  this woman's husband. He was there. On market. Did you sleep with the woman's husband? No. Then
[33:50.880 --> 33:58.160]  you didn't have a threesome. What are you dumb? On market. What do you think a threesome is? You
[31:23.980 --> 31:31.980]  And names that seem to indicate matrinal heritage called Xing emerged in China around 4000 to 3000 B.C.
[31:31.980 --> 31:32.980]  Nice.
[31:32.980 --> 31:33.980]  All right.
[31:33.980 --> 31:34.980]  There's some good information from Doug Vaughn.
[31:34.980 --> 31:35.980]  My ears are bleeding right now.
[31:35.980 --> 31:36.980]  Are you guys from Colorado?
[31:36.980 --> 31:37.980]  What's that?
[31:37.980 --> 31:40.980]  How did Jesus have a last name and God doesn't?
[31:40.980 --> 31:42.980]  What was Jesus' last name?
[31:42.980 --> 31:43.980]  Christ.
[31:43.980 --> 31:45.980]  Yes, it is.
[31:45.980 --> 31:48.980]  His name is Jesuit Christ.
[31:48.980 --> 31:50.980]  Jesus is an answer.
[32:19.380 --> 32:23.220]  If your insurance costs a leg at an arm, call James Carlton, State Farm.

[33:58.160 --> 34:01.520]  think every guy's got to sleep with the other guy for it to be a threesome? I think the three
[34:01.520 --> 34:07.120]  people are in the bed together. It's gonna be hot. He was in the bed with you? Yes. Was he clothed?
[34:07.760 --> 34:14.160]  No, baby. He was naked in bed with you? I think we've talked about this two years ago. No, I don't
[34:14.160 --> 34:20.320]  think we've got this detail. Yes, we did. I don't think so. Run it back, baby. Run it back.
[34:21.440 --> 34:27.440]  Well, I remember the story of you walking in and there was some some passion going on and then you
[31:50.980 --> 31:52.980]  So close to Christmas, too.
[31:52.980 --> 31:57.980]  No, in all honesty, that's his last name, right?
[31:57.980 --> 32:00.980]  It used to be your last name was where you were born.
[32:00.980 --> 32:01.980]  It was from.
[32:01.980 --> 32:02.980]  It would be like Jesus of Nazareth.
[32:02.980 --> 32:03.980]  Jesus of Jerusalem.
[32:03.980 --> 32:04.980]  Mary Magdalene of Bethlehem.
[32:04.980 --> 32:08.980]  This says one of the earliest civilizations to adopt last names is China.
[32:08.980 --> 32:14.980]  Over 3000 years ago, people there supposedly adopted family names as last names to enhance their census.
[32:49.300 --> 32:52.500]  The last one of the year for December, welcome to a Briar Side to Kill with Malogra.
[32:52.500 --> 32:55.020]  Just go to tmas.com.

[33:03.340 --> 33:06.940]  That is sound story, it will last multiple lifetime generations.

[33:09.180 --> 33:13.580]  You can pick between a ton of different personalities, including me, Doug, Tim,
[33:13.580 --> 33:18.180]  a ton of people across the building, just left and right, mysoundstory.com.
[34:27.440 --> 34:33.120]  folded up your clothes neatly and joined the join the Farkas. Frakas? Frakas. I'm thinking of
[34:33.120 --> 34:37.360]  Brady Farkas. I got a barrel in the mind. I'm not breaking any news here. But that's not the first
[34:37.360 --> 34:42.800]  time you've been naked in a bed with another gentleman. Not with, when I say with another
[34:42.800 --> 34:47.680]  gentleman, I'm not saying like you and him are engaging. Not in bed. On the edge of the bed.
[34:48.480 --> 34:55.520]  No. In a chair. No, the Heto. But that doesn't make it a threesome. That case it wouldn't. Yeah,
[32:15.980 --> 32:21.980]  The last names used by the Chinese were maternal surnames or their mother's surnames, which mothers passed down to them.
[32:21.980 --> 32:23.980]  My puppy says Jesus H. Macy.
[32:23.980 --> 32:26.980]  The oldest surname in the world is cats.
[32:26.980 --> 32:27.980]  K-A-T-Z.
[32:27.980 --> 32:28.980]  Oh, yeah.
[32:28.980 --> 32:32.980]  initials of the two words Cohen, Tezdak.
[32:32.980 --> 32:38.980]  Every cats is a priest sending in an unbroken line from Aaron, the brother of Moses, 1300 B.C.
[32:38.980 --> 32:39.980]  Book one.
[32:39.980 --> 32:41.980]  They can bash it in the text.
[33:18.180 --> 33:20.900]  Let's get into the design, air, heating and cooling.
[33:20.900 --> 33:22.900]  Email today.
[33:22.900 --> 33:26.220]  At first I thought to myself, no Tim, no Lissy.
[33:26.220 --> 33:28.060]  Oh, no Lissy.
[33:28.060 --> 33:29.980]  But sure glad I did.
[33:29.980 --> 33:34.180]  The threesome story where another man inserted his digits in Iggy is definitely new information.
[33:34.180 --> 33:34.820]  I'm not judging.
[33:34.820 --> 33:37.100]  Heck, it happened to me this week.
[33:37.100 --> 33:40.180]  For I too got a ride home from the awards ceremonies.
[33:40.180 --> 33:41.780]  He was like, no need to thank me.
[33:41.780 --> 33:43.660]  I've always wanted to see Jefferson County.
[33:43.660 --> 33:47.140]  I rarely get outside as a 63127.
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.520]  you probably write those but this was I will I will back Iggy on this. This was this was a three.
[35:01.520 --> 35:03.120]  Yeah, the other one was kind of like a cucking.
[35:05.120 --> 35:10.320]  Like cucking. Yeah, they sit on the bed and give me instructions and I berate them.
[35:11.120 --> 35:13.440]  I think I'm gonna start watching homework movies.
[35:14.400 --> 35:18.240]  A little bit better about the world. You got pure purifiers. That time of year. There's all over
[35:18.240 --> 35:22.880]  the place. Why they do crank them out. Well, question because I've been doing a lot. Are
[32:41.980 --> 32:46.980]  It's not our fault you guys haven't thought of this yet, and we're first bringing it to the.
[32:46.980 --> 32:47.980]  Right.
[32:47.980 --> 32:49.980]  And here's the Jesus answer.
[32:49.980 --> 32:51.980]  Jesus didn't have a formal last name.
[32:51.980 --> 32:56.980]  Instead, he was most commonly called Jesus, son of Joseph or Jesus of Nazareth.
[32:56.980 --> 32:57.980]  That's what I understand.
[32:57.980 --> 33:02.980]  After his resurrection, he was called Jesus Christ to show that he is the Messiah and Savior of the world.
[33:02.980 --> 33:05.980]  See.
[33:05.980 --> 33:06.980]  Tim Christ.
[33:06.980 --> 33:10.980]  I don't know how you can add a last name post death, but it is what it is.
[33:47.140 --> 33:51.260]  As we exited at Richardson Road, I noticed his pants were unzipped.
[33:51.260 --> 33:52.540]  We have to make a stop.
[33:52.540 --> 33:53.860]  I'm Ubering on the side.
[33:53.860 --> 33:56.220]  They pay extra to ride in the convertible.
[33:56.220 --> 34:00.580]  And that is the romantic story of the time I received the Kit Kat shuffle from a pet smart worker
[34:00.580 --> 34:07.620]  while simultaneously making out with a khaki tall drink of water underneath the phallic symbol Arnold water tower.
[34:07.620 --> 34:12.540]  That comes from first name Heywood, last name, Jeboémy.
[34:12.540 --> 34:14.900]  Heywood, Jeboémy.
[34:14.900 --> 34:15.660]  Weird last name.
[34:15.660 --> 34:16.500]  French.
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.040]  you guys are you guys good gift givers? Would you just know I never know what they I never have. I
[35:27.040 --> 35:31.120]  have no idea what to get anybody. I love giving gifts. I don't like getting them. I love giving
[35:31.120 --> 35:37.360]  them them. We're a philanthropist heart. Yeah, I don't care if I get gifts or not. I just like
[35:37.360 --> 35:41.840]  giving gifts. I'm just bad at it, man. Like I was walking through the mall yesterday. I just have no
[35:41.840 --> 35:47.600]  clue like I like those really nice. I was talking I called my brother because I wanted to like ask
[33:10.980 --> 33:13.980]  I just assumed that was his last name for his entire life.
[33:13.980 --> 33:14.980]  No, it didn't Ben.
[33:14.980 --> 33:16.980]  When Ben her, that was his last name.
[33:16.980 --> 33:19.980]  I believe that was just a fictitious movie.
[33:19.980 --> 33:22.980]  Ben her short movie to real quick one.
[33:22.980 --> 33:24.980]  I think his name was Noah Ben her.
[33:24.980 --> 33:26.980]  See, when went the first.
[33:26.980 --> 33:30.980]  When do we start giving birth certificates out?
[33:30.980 --> 33:33.980]  Probably around the time of a long time.
[33:33.980 --> 33:35.980]  We're human keeping records.
[33:35.980 --> 33:36.980]  Yeah.
[33:36.980 --> 33:37.980]  We're courted.
[35:47.600 --> 35:52.880]  what his wife my sister in law might want and stuff and she's not listening. So I can say,
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.680]  but like you go buy like those like soap or like lotion shops like that are like sell like the nice
[35:57.680 --> 36:02.160]  fancy lotions. And I think those stores are exclusively made for people who have no idea
[36:02.160 --> 36:07.200]  what to get women for the holidays and they stare you to a real expensive product. Yeah,
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.520]  you don't know anything like I think that's the sole reason that those fancy lotion places exist
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.160]  because guys do not know what to get women for the holidays or their birthdays and they know they
[34:16.500 --> 34:17.220]  Jeboémy.
[34:17.220 --> 34:18.900]  He's Dutch.
[34:18.900 --> 34:19.620]  Yack.
[34:19.620 --> 34:20.700]  And Young.
[34:20.700 --> 34:22.140]  Big game for the Colts this weekend.
[34:22.140 --> 34:23.540]  They're in the hunt for a playoff spot.
[34:23.540 --> 34:27.740]  Probably need a win against insert team name on insert date.
[34:27.740 --> 34:29.460]  Jonathan Taylor was in his questionable dog.
[34:29.460 --> 34:30.580]  So keep an eye on his status.
[34:30.580 --> 34:31.540]  I know I will.
[34:31.540 --> 34:31.860]  Thanks.
[34:31.860 --> 34:34.220]  That's the number one Asian intern Brian Henshin.
[34:34.220 --> 34:39.060]  I did not bake a carrot cake last night, but I'm holding out for a win by default today.
[34:39.060 --> 34:40.820]  Brian Henshin.
[34:40.820 --> 34:42.020]  Let me know if Taylor's playing.
[34:42.020 --> 34:44.860]  I'd like to play Zach Moss.
[34:44.860 --> 34:45.700]  What does that do?
[33:37.980 --> 33:42.980]  Whenever you start seeing the first things of being recorded, that's when stuff started getting recorded.
[33:42.980 --> 33:48.980]  His legal is legal name was Jesus of Nazareth because that was the homeland of Joseph.
[33:48.980 --> 33:51.980]  Christ became because he fulfilled a prophecy of the Old Testament.
[33:51.980 --> 33:52.980]  It wasn't his legal name.
[33:52.980 --> 33:53.980]  I don't know if they had.
[33:53.980 --> 33:54.980]  We should bring that back.
[33:54.980 --> 33:55.980]  Darren of Peoria.
[33:55.980 --> 33:56.980]  Yeah.
[33:56.980 --> 33:57.980]  Darren Darren of Canton.
[33:57.980 --> 33:58.980]  Yeah, like I love that.
[33:58.980 --> 33:59.980]  Doug of Wichita.
[33:59.980 --> 34:00.980]  Is that you know which?
[34:00.980 --> 34:02.980]  Well, I was born in El Dorado.
[34:02.980 --> 34:03.980]  Oh, wow.
[34:03.980 --> 34:05.980]  That'd be kind of the El Dorado.
[34:05.980 --> 34:06.980]  Douglas.
[36:16.160 --> 36:20.000]  smell nice. So sign them up. Well, it's not a creative gift, but everybody likes to get gift
[36:20.000 --> 36:26.160]  cards. Yeah, I know. It's such it's the move like I know that like the Seinfeld thing where Jerry gets
[36:26.160 --> 36:30.240]  a lane cash and that's a that's a real problem because she's like, well, you my uncle.
[36:30.960 --> 36:35.040]  But in all honesty, like I'm sure you can attest to this Doug with your youngest son.
[36:35.680 --> 36:39.600]  I would want nothing more than just cash. That would be the perfect gift.
[34:45.700 --> 34:47.500]  I don't know what that was.
[34:47.500 --> 34:49.940]  Chapter one, the keys to success.
[34:49.940 --> 34:54.860]  How did the 1992 pasta house softball team lead an unqualified chronic masturbator with
[34:54.860 --> 34:57.980]  no media experience to over 30 years on sports talk radio?
[34:57.980 --> 35:01.380]  Listen carefully if you want to follow my in poverty stricken footsteps.
[35:01.380 --> 35:02.820]  Step one, write it down.
[35:02.820 --> 35:05.900]  If you have a funny story or bright idea, always write it down and keep your content
[35:05.900 --> 35:07.700]  somewhere safe like a floppy disk.
[35:07.700 --> 35:11.020]  VHS or some other obsolete technology.
[35:11.020 --> 35:12.940]  Step two, why why why?
[35:12.940 --> 35:15.220]  Remember, the truth is for suckers.
[34:06.980 --> 34:07.980]  That's like your porn name.
[34:07.980 --> 34:08.980]  You're really.
[34:08.980 --> 34:10.980]  That'd be pretty good.
[34:10.980 --> 34:11.980]  Doug, I don't mind it.
[34:11.980 --> 34:12.980]  Doug of El Dorado.
[34:12.980 --> 34:14.980]  Like Monday night, I made a carrot cake.
[34:14.980 --> 34:17.980]  What in God's name does that have to do with what we're talking about?
[34:17.980 --> 34:18.980]  What kind of project is that?
[34:18.980 --> 34:20.980]  Well, I said this a lot of times.
[34:20.980 --> 34:25.980]  I just think of things, you know, I do the last first last name, but I was making a carrot cake.
[34:25.980 --> 34:30.980]  I said, whoever thought that a vegetable would make a good cake and why a carrot?
[34:30.980 --> 34:32.980]  I mean, do you ever heard of a green bean cake?
[34:32.980 --> 34:33.980]  You ever heard of a pea cake?
[34:33.980 --> 34:34.980]  Why don't you start it?
[34:34.980 --> 34:35.980]  Why carrots?
[36:39.600 --> 36:46.160]  Oh, yeah, that's but it depends on her profession. You know, I think nice coat handbag. You got
[36:46.160 --> 36:51.280]  yourself a lot of options there, but a handbag can be a couple hundred dollars or more than that.
[36:51.280 --> 36:56.160]  And you never know if they're going to like it or not. Well, there's always returning. It's always
[36:56.160 --> 37:00.800]  an option. There's two ways of looking at your car. You go out of your way and try to, you know,
[37:01.520 --> 37:06.880]  if it doesn't work, just return it. How about bowling shoes? I'd rather go all out and then
[35:15.220 --> 35:17.340]  Those weren't my tire tracks on that wet fairway.
[35:17.340 --> 35:18.340]  That picture was photoshopped.
[35:18.340 --> 35:20.420]  Yeah, I banged over 500 women.
[35:20.420 --> 35:21.900]  Just ask Verma Troyer's cousin.
[35:21.900 --> 35:23.460]  Did Verma Troyer have a cousin?
[35:23.460 --> 35:25.300]  No one knows, but it sounds cool.
[35:25.300 --> 35:28.540]  That leads me to my next point, which is, of course, step three, name dropping D list
[35:28.540 --> 35:29.540]  celebrities.
[35:29.540 --> 35:33.700]  Leo Remini, W. Earl Brown, Champagne Tony Lima's niece.
[35:33.700 --> 35:37.100]  People respect you more if you casually mentioned obscure celebrity names like you're an old
[35:37.100 --> 35:38.100]  pals.
[35:38.100 --> 35:41.900]  Most importantly, after you interview someone famous, call them your friend or even better
[35:41.900 --> 35:43.780]  claim that they really want to have sex with you.
[35:43.780 --> 35:45.100]  Yeah, that's the tippet.
[37:06.880 --> 37:12.880]  have to return something and go way too safe and kind of box yourself. I had two pair at home. I
[37:12.880 --> 37:16.080]  can sell you if you're looking for bowling shoes. But those probably wouldn't fit.
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.960]  Based with Martha's. You know what? You know what women don't want is things that they have to work
[37:20.960 --> 37:24.320]  with. Like you give them a vacuum cleaner or something. They don't think that's funny at all.
[37:25.120 --> 37:34.320]  Hair product, new hair dryer. He put in some bit of food and then immediately ran to the mic.
[34:36.980 --> 34:40.980]  And it works, but never heard anybody make an asparagus cake, have you?
[34:40.980 --> 34:43.980]  It's a good point, though, as we talk about Jesus Christ.
[34:44.980 --> 34:45.980]  You're working on like a tight five?
[34:45.980 --> 34:47.980]  No, it's just things that popped into my mind.
[34:47.980 --> 34:49.980]  And that popped into my mind when I was making the carrot cake.
[34:49.980 --> 34:53.980]  Speaking of names, my son John asked one of the nurses at the hospital yesterday,
[34:53.980 --> 34:57.980]  so what are the, some of the oddest names you've heard of baby's name.
[34:57.980 --> 35:00.980]  And the nurse said, well, we had a couple twins a little while ago,
[35:00.980 --> 35:03.980]  and the mother named them De Best and De Finest.
[35:03.980 --> 35:04.980]  Oh, man.
[35:45.980 --> 35:47.980]  Step four, brag about it.
[35:47.980 --> 35:51.500]  You can struggle to make ends meet for most of your adult life if you aren't willing to
[35:51.500 --> 35:55.140]  constantly remind people about the time you made Mickey Mantle cry.
[35:55.140 --> 35:57.860]  Finally, step five, writing coattails.
[35:57.860 --> 36:02.140]  Coattails hit your wagon to someone with a good reputation and solid work ethic and hang
[36:02.140 --> 36:03.140]  on for dear life.
[36:03.140 --> 36:04.140]  Who knows?
[36:04.140 --> 36:08.820]  Maybe you can even guilt your pauses associated to giving you a free car if your junker evaporates
[36:08.820 --> 36:09.820]  on the highway.
[36:09.820 --> 36:11.780]  If you want to hear more, you'll have to buy the book.
[36:11.780 --> 36:13.780]  It's from the JV golf club.
[37:35.280 --> 37:39.600]  Not one shoe had gone down before you start talking. What is that?
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.760]  Granola bar. All right. Peanut butter, chocolate chip. High in protein. Oh, they're sticky. Now,
[37:45.760 --> 37:52.400]  the gift card, you can look at it two ways. Either says, I really want you to get what you want.
[37:52.400 --> 37:55.760]  So I gave you the gift card. You can go buy what you want. So I'm not giving you something you
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.240]  don't want. Or you can look at it just lazy. I don't even want to look for something. So I'm
[38:00.240 --> 38:03.840]  just going to give you a gift card. Yeah. But like if it's like clothes or something, like I want to
[35:05.980 --> 35:06.980]  I got to say, I love it.
[35:06.980 --> 35:07.980]  Yeah.
[35:07.980 --> 35:08.980]  Because you have De Coldest, who's a...
[35:08.980 --> 35:09.980]  Yeah, De Coldest Crawford.
[35:09.980 --> 35:11.980]  De Colder Crawford, who's a football player.
[35:11.980 --> 35:12.980]  Yeah, I like it.
[35:12.980 --> 35:13.980]  I like a unique name.
[35:13.980 --> 35:14.980]  Why not?
[35:14.980 --> 35:16.980]  Like De Best and De Finest?
[35:17.980 --> 35:18.980]  Yeah.
[35:18.980 --> 35:21.980]  I think it all depends on what somebody, some people like things.
[35:21.980 --> 35:22.980]  Some people don't like other things.
[35:22.980 --> 35:25.980]  Well, what if you like, what if you're named after like De Finest, Missouri?
[35:26.980 --> 35:31.980]  Well, man, if you're named after De Finest, you got a long uphill climb.
[35:31.980 --> 35:32.980]  Doug, look what De Playah looks like.
[35:32.980 --> 35:33.980]  I thought opening up a honey bun.
[36:13.780 --> 36:15.900]  JV golf coach.
[36:15.900 --> 36:20.460]  Good morning to whom it may concern at the TMA sound story Biffen guy who hates him and
[36:20.460 --> 36:22.780]  all other pub or programming.
[36:22.780 --> 36:28.660]  Our agency is proud to announce we now represent Ken Iggy Strode as of December 2023.
[36:28.660 --> 36:33.260]  As such, this is your first and only gentle reminder that all interactions and or viewed
[36:33.260 --> 36:38.900]  commercials with learn must be disclosed to our client within five minutes of exposure.
[36:38.900 --> 36:42.740]  Failure to do so will result in pout-pout sessions or missed work from our client under
[38:03.840 --> 38:08.560]  pick that out. Like if it's like a pair of pants, like I have certain things I like in a pair of
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.520]  pants that some people might not know, I would soon I guess if you get somebody a gift like that
[38:13.520 --> 38:16.320]  and then give them the gift receipt, it's essentially giving them a gift card because
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.520]  you can just go return it and then get the credit. But yeah, I just I never know what to give. I like
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.720]  getting people like books, but I feel like that's kind of a cop out gift to three pack massage and
[38:26.720 --> 38:32.320]  probably 150. Yeah. That's a good experience. Sound story is obviously a fantastic gift.
[35:33.980 --> 35:34.980]  I'm Hoosier, I know.
[35:34.980 --> 35:37.980]  I have the ability to make fun of other Hoosiers.
[35:37.980 --> 35:40.980]  I brought you in a lot of things I didn't like.
[35:40.980 --> 35:41.980]  I did see that.
[35:41.980 --> 35:44.980]  It seems to be a very common trend here.
[35:44.980 --> 35:46.980]  I think I like one of those I've had before.
[35:46.980 --> 35:49.980]  One of the bonds, I think of the longer chocolate ones.
[35:49.980 --> 35:51.980]  Yeah, one is like turtle brownies.
[35:51.980 --> 35:54.980]  The other one is like a cake stick.
[35:54.980 --> 35:55.980]  Yeah, that's cake stick.
[35:55.980 --> 35:59.980]  Then I brought you in a bag of caramel popcorn I didn't want that I got for a Christmas present.
[35:59.980 --> 36:00.980]  I didn't really want it.
[36:00.980 --> 36:01.980]  Nope.
[36:01.980 --> 36:02.980]  That's enough of the name, game.
[36:42.740 --> 36:45.940]  the guise of hurting an arm in the kitchen bath.
[36:45.940 --> 36:46.940]  Thank you.
[36:46.940 --> 36:51.820]  That's from the Gunter agency DVA FU Mardukis and wrangling your family, beer cats.
[36:51.820 --> 36:53.900]  Gunter agency.
[36:53.900 --> 37:00.540]  Finally, Jesus was born Jesus H Christ in a manger in Bethlehem on December 25th in
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.540]  the year zero.
[37:01.540 --> 37:04.860]  Anyone who ever studied the King Darren Bible knows that.
[37:04.860 --> 37:08.020]  Since Jackson doesn't know what gift to buy his lady friend, I'll suggest getting your
[37:08.020 --> 37:09.940]  tickets to see Mizzou by Central Arkansas.
[37:09.940 --> 37:12.420]  Mizzou are in on Saturday, December 30th.
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.160]  Legitimately like a standing gift. That's something you can have forever. And that's
[38:36.160 --> 38:42.640]  lovely. Go to my soundstory.com. Get that taken care of real quickly. 20% off at the moment. But
[38:42.640 --> 38:49.120]  I just I don't I don't know like whatever to get anybody. I'm getting soap, some getting lotions.
[38:49.120 --> 38:53.920]  I just feel like it's insincere. I know I would never want to get a gift of soap.
[38:55.840 --> 39:01.600]  That's because you're dirty. Boys are so much easier to shop for. Yeah. Because with kids and
[37:12.420 --> 37:15.860]  And make sure to include a Marcus Denman throwback jersey for the word of the game.
[37:15.860 --> 37:20.100]  Definitely don't get a $25 gift card for a place that costs 30 an hour before you buy
[37:20.100 --> 37:22.580]  an overpriced food or drinks.
[37:22.580 --> 37:27.420]  HOK was indeed the architect on the dome and their original designs include a roof that
[37:27.420 --> 37:29.140]  allowed natural light to enter the building.
[37:29.140 --> 37:32.800]  But those ideas were scrapped because they were told it would be better for conventions
[37:32.800 --> 37:34.300]  if they had no natural light.
[37:34.300 --> 37:39.460]  Hence, we are three decades later in basically the same spot we were in in 1993, except there's
[37:39.460 --> 37:41.340]  no chance we'll get another NFL team.
[36:02.980 --> 36:03.980]  Shut up, idiots.
[36:03.980 --> 36:04.980]  It's Ken time, baby.
[36:04.980 --> 36:05.980]  I made a carrot cake.
[36:05.980 --> 36:09.980]  Yep, me, Kenny, the possum strode of house leather.
[36:09.980 --> 36:10.980]  That's from Brian Henshin.
[36:10.980 --> 36:11.980]  The house of leather.
[36:11.980 --> 36:13.980]  Beep, boop, beep, boop, bop, boop, beep.
[36:13.980 --> 36:14.980]  Gates worth them.
[36:14.980 --> 36:15.980]  House leather.
[36:15.980 --> 36:19.980]  Play, plowhawk, play the hijack sound.
[36:19.980 --> 36:21.980]  You should make the first bleach cake and let us know how it is.
[36:21.980 --> 36:22.980]  This is Ravey.
[36:22.980 --> 36:24.980]  This is Ravey, by the way.
[36:24.980 --> 36:26.980]  The first bleach cake.
[36:26.980 --> 36:29.980]  We could sell those probably as part of the TMA.
[36:29.980 --> 36:30.980]  Mercendign 100%.
[39:01.680 --> 39:07.440]  even friends, you buy them a jersey or something and they're good. If they golf, easy. I can always
[39:08.080 --> 39:12.240]  a box of Pro-V ones is an outstanding gift for any golfer. Like that's a perfect gift.
[39:12.240 --> 39:15.040]  Women don't know what they want themselves. How are we supposed to know?
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.280]  Dude, women get it themselves throughout the year. So it comes to Christian and he goes,
[39:19.280 --> 39:22.320]  Oh, what do you want? Oh, I already got everything. Ultimately, it's about the effort.
[39:22.320 --> 39:26.560]  Awesome. Thank you for the. It is truly about like the effort of just going in and getting
[39:26.560 --> 39:30.720]  something that is nice. That's what gift giving is about. It's not about the product itself.
[37:41.340 --> 37:44.500]  Downtown is abandoned wasteland where no sports teams are playing.
[37:44.500 --> 37:47.180]  Homeless people are perpetually camped outside City Hall.
[37:47.180 --> 37:50.780]  The police are crashing their SUVs and gay bars and doubling down by arresting the others
[37:50.780 --> 37:52.940]  at the bar that they crashed into.
[37:52.940 --> 37:55.540]  And worst of all, there's no McDonald's boat on the riverfront.
[37:55.540 --> 38:00.380]  Makes me makes me sick mother effer how far we done fell.
[38:00.380 --> 38:02.340]  Iggy, I'll be glad to help you with your book.
[38:02.340 --> 38:04.860]  Please stop saving your work on a floppy disk.
[38:04.860 --> 38:09.020]  Floppy disks are vulnerable to extreme heat, extreme cold, extreme humidity, water damage,
[36:31.980 --> 36:33.980]  Jesus, get him to shut up.
[36:33.980 --> 36:34.980]  That's from painter guy.
[36:34.980 --> 36:36.980]  Isn't it something you ever thought about, buddy?
[36:36.980 --> 36:38.980]  I think Iggy was the first man to have ADD.
[36:38.980 --> 36:39.980]  That's from Jabab the Bucky.
[36:39.980 --> 36:44.980]  Well, we were talking about first things and I was just wondering who came up with a vegetable
[36:44.980 --> 36:46.980]  would make a good cake.
[36:46.980 --> 36:47.980]  It does, it works.
[36:47.980 --> 36:48.980]  Yeah, it does.
[36:48.980 --> 36:50.980]  But you wouldn't think of any other vegetable on a cake, would you?
[36:50.980 --> 36:54.980]  I'm curious like who was the first guy to be like, man, we smell.
[36:54.980 --> 36:55.980]  And then like soap were created.
[36:55.980 --> 36:56.980]  Well, I guess.
[36:56.980 --> 36:58.980]  Who noted the first time somebody goes in?
[39:31.360 --> 39:36.880]  Having said that, I find it very difficult to buy gifts. Not because like I don't want to buy gifts.
[39:36.880 --> 39:41.040]  I just don't know what to get anybody. So suggestions, send them on in. What do you get your
[39:41.040 --> 39:48.960]  people's people's. I know pad everything. Anytime Madison mentioned something that she may want.
[39:48.960 --> 39:54.800]  Yeah, sweet. Pad that. That's the that's the key off whenever you she does buy it herself
[39:54.800 --> 39:59.200]  throughout the year and then whatever is left and kind of still. That's the key. Pause. Listen,
[38:09.020 --> 38:11.500]  dust, spending, and physical damage from other objects.
[38:11.500 --> 38:15.420]  You might as well type it into a typewriter and keep your holy copy in your oven next
[38:15.420 --> 38:16.420]  to your money.
[38:16.420 --> 38:17.420]  That's from Buck Swope.
[38:17.420 --> 38:20.060]  Buck Swope with a nice little email this morning.
[38:20.060 --> 38:21.060]  Doug, what you got?
[38:21.060 --> 38:22.060]  Good.
[38:22.060 --> 38:27.820]  I believe it comes down to between the Gunter Agency and Buck Swope.
[38:27.820 --> 38:33.860]  And because of his nice advice with the floppy disk, I'm going to say Buck Swope.
[38:33.860 --> 38:36.420]  Well, it's not pretty much advice for anything.
[40:00.080 --> 40:05.040]  always listen. That's the key man. They will throw hints all year, bro. I'm talking May, June.
[40:05.760 --> 40:11.440]  And it's all year. You just got to have those. We don't have to wait till Christmas to get the gift.
[40:11.440 --> 40:16.720]  Well, that's the problem too is I typically would like that. We'll get each other. Like she's great
[40:16.720 --> 40:21.520]  at that. She that's the worst thing about gift giving is competing with someone who's unbelievable
[40:21.520 --> 40:28.000]  at it. Because I think I'm good at it. But Madison's unreal. Like I just anticipate her just going
[36:58.980 --> 36:59.980]  Another guy named Wright Guard.
[36:59.980 --> 37:01.980]  We have some body odor up in them.
[37:01.980 --> 37:06.980]  I guess it's like if everybody smells bad, you don't notice that.
[37:06.980 --> 37:12.980]  And like if they have no way of cleaning up the streets, then like horse manure is just everywhere.
[37:12.980 --> 37:14.980]  Homeless people probably don't notice that it smells it.
[37:14.980 --> 37:19.980]  Yeah, it's just that if everything smells, then you have your point of reference, your frame of reference, I should say.
[37:19.980 --> 37:22.980]  I've had cavemen that smell very, very good.
[37:22.980 --> 37:24.980]  Except Raquel Welch in one million years BC.
[37:24.980 --> 37:26.980]  She's like she smelled pretty good.
[37:26.980 --> 37:27.980]  She looked good until the day she died, Doug.
[38:36.420 --> 38:39.860]  It's heat, cold, fire, water.
[38:39.860 --> 38:40.860]  Bending.
[38:40.860 --> 38:44.180]  Well, if your information is digitally stored, it won't matter.
[38:44.180 --> 38:45.180]  Encrypted.
[38:45.180 --> 38:48.860]  Yeah, I'm going to go with, God, they all sucked.
[38:48.860 --> 38:52.060]  Hey, I'm going to go with Gunter.
[38:52.060 --> 38:54.980]  Gunter, I will go with Buck Swope.
[38:54.980 --> 38:55.980]  Oh, I'll be darned.
[38:55.980 --> 38:56.980]  Okay, Buck Swope has won.
[38:56.980 --> 38:57.980]  Wow.
[38:57.980 --> 38:58.980]  That gives him five email wins on the month.
[38:58.980 --> 39:01.660]  He's probably locked it up tomorrow, or last day, isn't it?
[39:01.660 --> 39:02.660]  Month of December.
[39:02.660 --> 39:03.660]  Yeah, tomorrow is the last.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.080]  above and beyond again this year. Similar to what her parents do as well. I think that's in the
[40:32.080 --> 40:38.080]  family. They go all out. It's hard to compete with that. Can't go wrong with a nice box of chocolates.
[40:38.640 --> 40:44.400]  There you go. I think that who gave us those. That's a corporate corporate. We got them every
[40:44.400 --> 40:49.440]  year, Doug. This is our drops off. Very nice of them. That's a little eight pack of chocolates.
[40:49.440 --> 40:54.640]  I got a gift for sweet sweet Kai. A nice new Tempur-Pedic pillow for him to bite down on when
[37:27.980 --> 37:28.980]  Yeah, she did.
[37:28.980 --> 37:32.980]  If you listen to Pepper and Jeannie, we did discuss kind of cavemen etiquette.
[37:32.980 --> 37:34.980]  That was my perfect question.
[37:34.980 --> 37:36.980]  Yeah, it was a good episode.
[37:36.980 --> 37:42.980]  One of them was like, you know, because we were on the topic obviously of, you know, who first wiped.
[37:42.980 --> 37:44.980]  Oh, that was the right question.
[37:44.980 --> 37:51.980]  When you're on that topic, obviously you're back to cavemen days, and you just talked about just the smell of the BO.
[39:03.900 --> 39:07.580]  Buck Swope has just locked up the month of December, which is perfect because he won
[39:07.580 --> 39:11.540]  emailer of the year at the TMA Listener Year End Awards.
[39:11.540 --> 39:13.980]  Well, yeah, he emails every day.
[39:13.980 --> 39:14.980]  It's hard to beat him.
[39:14.980 --> 39:15.980]  Hard to beat him.
[39:15.980 --> 39:16.980]  Kevin Miller does as well.
[39:16.980 --> 39:17.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:17.980 --> 39:18.980]  He tries.
[39:18.980 --> 39:20.620]  JB Golf Coach pretty much every day.
[39:20.620 --> 39:21.620]  There's some effort.
[39:21.620 --> 39:24.620]  There's plenty of effort there, Brian Henschenboule, executive, but Buck Swope will take the month
[39:24.620 --> 39:29.140]  of December, and we will be closing up shop today.
[40:55.040 --> 40:59.360]  I gape pound that ass. Hey, that's not the Christmas spirit. The recovering alcoholic. Well,
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.440]  I mean, it's thoughtful. It's a gift that Gabe's giving. Buy folks a Sibian. That's from Derry
[41:03.440 --> 41:09.760]  Chewbacca. It's generally used. Too expensive. But if you get a gift card from somebody and you know
[41:09.760 --> 41:16.560]  your significant other will use it more, is it okay to pass along that gift card to her stocking?
[41:18.560 --> 41:23.040]  Even though it was probably so. She'll never know. You can read. Just don't tell. Jackson knows.
[37:51.980 --> 37:56.980]  But in terms of like no wiping, or if you did, it's with your hand.
[37:56.980 --> 38:00.980]  Can you imagine that cave at night after a big stew?
[38:00.980 --> 38:02.980]  Well, you know, dogs don't wipe.
[38:02.980 --> 38:04.980]  They don't have a big stew.
[38:04.980 --> 38:06.980]  A big muskrat stew.
[38:06.980 --> 38:08.980]  Dogs don't wipe, and they don't always look dirty.
[38:08.980 --> 38:13.980]  Yeah, but they pucker it perfectly.
[38:13.980 --> 38:15.980]  And they still got to get their anal glands expressed.
[38:15.980 --> 38:18.980]  We pay for that service every two months.
[38:18.980 --> 38:19.980]  Did Cleetus come by?
[39:29.140 --> 39:33.860]  Tune in to 101 ESPN, Josh Ennis taking over for Tim when he is out today on his vacation.
[39:33.860 --> 39:36.900]  He'll be out tomorrow on his vacation as well, so you get the same crew tomorrow for our
[39:36.900 --> 39:38.460]  final show of 2023.
[39:38.460 --> 39:40.740]  That will close out the Penn Ultimate show of 2023.
[39:40.740 --> 39:42.420]  He'll say Penn Ultimate.
[39:42.420 --> 39:43.420]  What a needless word.
[39:43.420 --> 39:46.060]  Just say next to the last.
[39:46.060 --> 39:52.340]  I like Penn Ultimate, and tomorrow will be the finale for 2023 for Doug, for Iggy, for
[39:52.340 --> 39:55.620]  the Plallock, for KG in Otown, and for Tim who is out on vacation.
[41:23.120 --> 41:27.200]  I know. I've done it before. So it's not like this is going to be my first road.
[41:28.960 --> 41:34.080]  It's the same thing as like, if you get your significant other or somebody like a gift card
[41:34.080 --> 41:42.880]  to a restaurant, you're probably going to use part of it. Oh yeah. What if you get a gift card to a
[41:42.880 --> 41:48.320]  restaurant or a store they don't like. So there, don't you just then just give them the visa gift
[41:48.320 --> 41:52.480]  card so they can spend it anywhere? That's my favorite gift ever. My uncle always gets me a
[39:55.620 --> 39:59.700]  This has been the morning after broadcasting live from the Michelobelter Studios and presented
[39:59.700 --> 40:01.180]  to you by Brown and Crouppen.
Transcribed and uploaded: 12-21-23_Segment_3_When_Darin_Beat_Goliath_&_EMOTD.json
[38:19.980 --> 38:26.980]  No, you can tell because when they start rubbing their butts on the carpet or like the blanket, and they start to smell, it's like, ah, they need a bucket.
[38:26.980 --> 38:29.980]  Is that worms? Is that worms that that's the case where they're scooting their butts?
[38:29.980 --> 38:32.980]  Sometimes, yeah, but these tip, we are just like needing their anal glands.
[38:32.980 --> 38:34.980]  Yeah, and black oil comes out.
[38:34.980 --> 38:37.980]  I don't watch it. I just send them in for a little visit.
[38:37.980 --> 38:40.980]  Plowsie, you ever smelled the underside of your dog's paw?
[38:40.980 --> 38:41.980]  I bet.
[38:41.980 --> 38:42.980]  Oh, dude, I've smelled it.
[38:42.980 --> 38:43.980]  Smells like Fritos.
[38:43.980 --> 38:44.980]  Yeah.
[38:44.980 --> 38:47.980]  My dog's ears smell like, like granny's ears smell like Fritos.
[41:52.480 --> 41:56.720]  visa gift card and it's the best. It's just the simply the best. Two years ago somebody gave me,
[41:57.360 --> 42:02.960]  we do a not rob their neighbor, but we pick a name out of a hat on Thanksgiving and you have to buy
[42:02.960 --> 42:08.800]  that person. The Secret Santa. Yeah. And that was 25, 50 bucks, whatever he had to spend. Well, my
[42:08.800 --> 42:15.120]  sister-in-laws, no it wasn't my sister-in-law. It was my niece's husband's
[38:47.980 --> 38:54.980]  Dogs, I've had my dog drag his nuts all on my under chin and all on my face one morning.
[38:54.980 --> 38:56.980]  Oh, Iggy's had that done to him too.
[38:56.980 --> 38:57.980]  Bring a teabagging?
[38:57.980 --> 39:00.980]  He literally teabagged me, looked at me and did it too.
[39:00.980 --> 39:02.980]  Really? Why would he do that?
[39:02.980 --> 39:04.980]  It was just one time, I don't know.
[39:04.980 --> 39:06.980]  Just wanted to get off the bed and he didn't want to like...
[39:06.980 --> 39:08.980]  Maybe it was horny.
[39:08.980 --> 39:09.980]  Did you enjoy it?
[39:09.980 --> 39:10.980]  They hump each other.
[39:10.980 --> 39:11.980]  No, God no.
[39:11.980 --> 39:12.980]  No, sorry.
[39:12.980 --> 39:13.980]  It was awful.
[42:15.200 --> 42:26.000]  mom and dad were in the list too. I don't even know them. So I got, she picked me and I got a
[42:26.000 --> 42:35.600]  $25 gift card to Topgolf. Nice. And I had her and I had no clue. And I think I gave her an Iggy for
[42:35.600 --> 42:44.400]  a mare shirt. Nice hat. Oh God. I would bet you've given away more than a fair share of promo items
[39:13.980 --> 39:18.980]  Hey guys, three minutes ago we were talking about Jesus' last name and now we're talking about people and how they wipe their butt.
[39:18.980 --> 39:20.980]  Keep up the great work, fellas.
[39:20.980 --> 39:22.980]  That's from Gary Pinkle's Cellphone Etiquette.
[39:22.980 --> 39:24.980]  Well, we were just bringing it back to...
[39:24.980 --> 39:26.980]  Because you talk about caveman and smelling, obviously.
[39:26.980 --> 39:33.980]  I remember the Pepper and Genie episode where we brought up caveman smells because it was the Who First Wiped episode.
[39:33.980 --> 39:35.980]  We're trying to be more relatable to our audience.
[39:35.980 --> 39:36.980]  Yeah.
[39:36.980 --> 39:37.980]  And get off the deep religious discussion.
[39:37.980 --> 39:38.980]  Right, right.
[42:45.360 --> 42:49.520]  I didn't, I never, I don't even think I even met the woman. A lot of licensed merchandise. And I said
[42:49.520 --> 42:54.480]  I'm just gonna give her an Iggy for a mare hat. Was it was it musky? No, I never worn it.
[42:55.760 --> 43:01.600]  That basically regifted. What did she say when she got it? She goes, who's Iggy? I said there we go.
[43:01.600 --> 43:05.120]  That's what I'm saying. This is, makes no sense. We don't even know each other and we're
[43:05.840 --> 43:12.240]  picking names and the guy who gave it to you, me, your daughter-in-law's uncle.
[39:38.980 --> 39:42.980]  Call in with your stories of name.
[39:42.980 --> 39:45.980]  I tried saying it a couple weeks ago, Doug, and you scolded me for it.
[39:45.980 --> 39:49.980]  I think I said entomology, which is a study of insects.
[39:49.980 --> 39:54.980]  But etymology, I think, is the study of words and how they formed.
[39:54.980 --> 39:56.980]  You can call in with any of those takes.
[39:56.980 --> 40:01.980]  That's 636-904 TMA, much like Care of the Lesbian, called in yesterday.
[40:01.980 --> 40:03.980]  You can also call in.
[40:03.980 --> 40:05.980]  You talk to KG Notan, and they'll get you on the air.
[43:12.240 --> 43:18.880]  I love how Iggy calls it Rob thy neighbor as if it was passed down from Moses himself. That's from
[43:18.880 --> 43:23.040]  Wolfboy. I didn't even say Rob thy neighbor. I didn't know what the name of it was. You know
[43:23.040 --> 43:29.840]  what Jackson Female is also like? Yeah. Super easy. So like buy them like you get, you guys do
[43:29.840 --> 43:34.480]  a cooking cloth together. I know they do that. Or they can do like the wine and like your, like you
[43:34.480 --> 43:39.360]  paint and like get a group of paint. Paint sip or whatever. So easy to do. You can almost do those
[40:05.980 --> 40:10.980]  We'd love to talk with the audience today and tomorrow because Tim is out today and tomorrow.
[40:10.980 --> 40:16.980]  On 101 ESPN, Josh Innes will be filling in for Tim today and tomorrow.
[40:16.980 --> 40:19.980]  I'll be running the board for those two days.
[40:19.980 --> 40:20.980]  Oh, cute.
[40:20.980 --> 40:21.980]  Yeah, it'll be fun.
[40:21.980 --> 40:25.980]  And then I do not know what the plan is on 101 for Tuesday through Friday of next week.
[40:25.980 --> 40:27.980]  Obviously, best of programming on Monday.
[40:27.980 --> 40:29.980]  Plenty of NFL, actually, on 101 ESPN.
[40:29.980 --> 40:31.980]  I love...
[40:31.980 --> 40:32.980]  I'm an NBA guy.
[40:32.980 --> 40:34.980]  I love the NBA on Christmas.
[43:39.360 --> 43:44.560]  online, get the online gift card and email them to her on Christmas. I know it sounds lame but.
[43:44.560 --> 43:51.280]  I agree. Experiences are always better like than like actual like, I don't know. A nice bottle of wine
[43:51.280 --> 43:57.040]  is also a good gift. Can't go wrong with a nice bottle of wine. Hey guys. Somebody stole it.
[43:57.040 --> 44:02.000]  Right. You can go wrong with a bottle of wine. It doesn't even get out of the building that you
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.680]  delivered it to. What got out of there? Just not in my hands. You think someone had a leg?
[40:34.980 --> 40:37.980]  I am a fan of the NFL on Christmas as well.
[40:37.980 --> 40:38.980]  That is cool.
[40:38.980 --> 40:39.980]  Are you?
[40:39.980 --> 40:40.980]  Yeah.
[40:40.980 --> 40:43.980]  Are they even a full skate of games on Christmas Eve?
[40:43.980 --> 40:45.980]  Full skate?
[40:45.980 --> 40:46.980]  A skate of games?
[40:46.980 --> 40:47.980]  Yeah.
[40:47.980 --> 40:48.980]  Full slate of games.
[40:48.980 --> 40:51.980]  I was looking at my fantasy semifinals and I was looking at the game.
[40:51.980 --> 40:55.980]  There's seriously some tonight, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.
[40:55.980 --> 40:57.980]  It's crazy.
[40:57.980 --> 40:59.980]  Are they doing a three-game Saturday again?
[40:59.980 --> 41:01.980]  No, they're doing...
[41:01.980 --> 41:03.980]  Yes, three-game Saturday, Bengals, Steelers, Bills, Chargers,
[44:08.560 --> 44:12.560]  This is why Neiman Marcus is the best store in the world around Christmas. They have every type of
[44:12.560 --> 44:15.520]  gift you could ever think of. Plus they have an option for any budget. Whether you're looking
[44:15.520 --> 44:22.160]  to spend $500 or $10,000. That comes from Mr. Lix. So he'll probably be getting his wife maybe
[44:22.160 --> 44:25.840]  some sort of like that fur coat that you were talking about. So the lowest thing in his budget
[44:25.840 --> 44:31.200]  is 500 bucks. I think anytime you're looking to buy a gift for a, you know, a boss or a neighbor
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.600]  or something, you're looking to spend at least $500. Right. At least. Lix has never been in
[41:03.980 --> 41:06.980]  Bills, Chargers, and Commanders and Jets.
[41:06.980 --> 41:07.980]  They get close to the end.
[41:07.980 --> 41:09.980]  They want almost every game to play for an initial.
[41:09.980 --> 41:10.980]  No, I'm sorry.
[41:10.980 --> 41:11.980]  No, I'm sorry.
[41:11.980 --> 41:16.980]  Saturday, they were only playing two games, Bengals and Steelers and Bills, Chargers.
[41:16.980 --> 41:22.980]  On Saturday, then, you get a five-game Sunday noon slate, a four...
[41:22.980 --> 41:27.980]  I'm sorry, six-game Sunday slate for noon, three games in the afternoon.
[41:27.980 --> 41:29.980]  Obviously, the Sunday Night Football game.
[41:29.980 --> 41:32.980]  And then three Christmas Day games, including Ravens and Iars.
[44:35.600 --> 44:39.120]  Saxophone. Even Marcus, he's never stepped foot in there. You don't think he ever has?
[44:39.120 --> 44:43.760]  No. He has his people going there for him. He's on the showroom floor. He's knocking all of his
[44:43.760 --> 44:48.960]  brain colognes. Shopping out of Coles. No, they're all at Coles. You shop at Coles. I know, but I'm
[44:48.960 --> 44:54.400]  poor. I turn Alex's and you have to go there regardless of any messages that might still
[44:54.400 --> 45:00.080]  need returning business. And little kids, we went to Fameth Bar and Coles so much to where like we
[41:32.980 --> 41:35.980]  That's the two best teams in the NFL, Doug.
[41:35.980 --> 41:37.980]  Possible Super Bowl matchup Monday.
[41:37.980 --> 41:38.980]  Right, yeah.
[41:38.980 --> 41:41.980]  I guess Joe Buck will be on the call for that, so...
[41:41.980 --> 41:42.980]  Perfect.
[41:42.980 --> 41:43.980]  Yeah.
[41:43.980 --> 41:44.980]  That'll be great.
[41:44.980 --> 41:45.980]  I think the Niners are the best team going right now.
[41:45.980 --> 41:47.980]  Yeah, and then the Ravens are top of the league in the East.
[41:47.980 --> 41:48.980]  Probably so.
[41:48.980 --> 41:49.980]  I like that.
[41:49.980 --> 41:52.980]  It makes Sunday Draft Kings easier because I always do the noon games.
[41:52.980 --> 41:57.980]  Yeah, six games on noon on Sunday, even with all this one Thursday night game.
[41:57.980 --> 41:58.980]  Saints and Rams tonight, Doug.
[41:58.980 --> 41:59.980]  If you're looking forward to that.
[41:59.980 --> 42:00.980]  I will not be watching that.
[42:00.980 --> 42:01.980]  No.
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.280]  would use them boxes as like boxes for Christmas. Like we would save all those. Remember the,
[45:05.280 --> 45:10.080]  every clothes that you got came in like a Fameth Bar box or Coles box. You didn't have to walk out
[45:10.080 --> 45:16.080]  and with a bag. They like folded it and boxed it up for you. We still have those boxes. Those are
[45:16.080 --> 45:21.520]  old school. I threw them away when I moved this time. I had like, I had like 30 Coles boxes
[45:21.520 --> 45:25.120]  because you just asked for them. You go in there, you get a couple of, like when I got the turtlenecks,
[45:25.120 --> 45:33.600]  I knew Christmas was coming up. So I said, and what I do is I get something for everybody who's
[45:33.600 --> 45:38.160]  going to be over for Christmas. And it's usually like Cardinal giveaway stuff, stuff in my closet.
[45:38.160 --> 45:42.240]  It's not stuff I bought. I said, it's fun. There's like 15 presents out there. I said, okay,
[45:42.800 --> 45:47.840]  you know, it's steel from your neighbor. Who gets to pick first? And oh, I got a Pools jersey.
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.880]  Next person. No, I got a wine. It's something around the house. But I always know I have to
[42:01.980 --> 42:03.980]  I'm not going to fight my TV to try to get it.
[42:03.980 --> 42:04.980]  I need...
[42:04.980 --> 42:07.980]  There might be where baseball and the NHL are going to be on that season.
[42:07.980 --> 42:11.980]  Well, when it gets to that, I'll sit down and take an hour and a half lesson from somebody
[42:11.980 --> 42:12.980]  on how to do it.
[42:12.980 --> 42:16.980]  But for now, I'm not giving you another $10 a month because I don't care enough about these games.
[42:16.980 --> 42:18.980]  I need Vianney Grud.
[42:18.980 --> 42:22.980]  Start off my semifinal hot tonight.
[42:23.980 --> 42:26.980]  All these crazy alien stories can't be true, can they?
[42:26.980 --> 42:29.980]  Hey, it's Steven Diener, host of the Unidentified Alien podcast.
[45:52.880 --> 45:58.000]  wrap that up. So I always come when I go to Colsey, I can I get 10 extra boxes. So for some
[45:58.000 --> 46:04.160]  reason, like 50 boxes. How many turtle next did you buy? Two, but I said I need some extra boxes.
[46:04.160 --> 46:11.440]  They give them to you. Some news here. Sorry to change the subjects a wildly here, but
[46:11.440 --> 46:16.880]  some news here for those who are into spring professional football, Doug. Yeah.
[42:29.980 --> 42:32.980]  And whether you're new to the conversation or have been looking into it for years, you
[42:32.980 --> 42:37.980]  need to check out the fastest growing alien show out there, the Unidentified Alien podcast
[42:37.980 --> 42:38.980]  or UAP for short.
[42:38.980 --> 42:42.980]  There's a crazy amount of alien encounter stories out there from all over the world.
[42:42.980 --> 42:46.980]  And the beauty of it is that I bring them all to you and that you decide what you believe.
[42:46.980 --> 42:50.980]  Download and subscribe to UAP on any of the major podcasting platforms.
[42:50.980 --> 42:53.980]  And you can also find it on UAPpodcast.com.
[46:17.360 --> 46:25.440]  Yeah. Franchise cuts begin as the USFL and the XFL mergers advance for USFL teams are notified
[46:25.440 --> 46:30.720]  that they will not survive the merged entity along with that. The XFL previously having teams in
[46:30.720 --> 46:35.200]  Arlington, Houston, Vegas, Orlando, Seattle, St. Louis, San Antonio, Washington, DC is expected
[46:35.200 --> 46:41.040]  that four of those teams will join the four surviving USFL teams to form a new a team
[46:41.040 --> 46:46.080]  league debuting in March of 2024. Well, you would think the battle onks would survive. Yeah, you'd
[42:54.980 --> 42:56.980]  Kyron Williams, hopefully you get me 20-25.
[42:56.980 --> 42:58.980]  Yeah, I've played him a couple weeks ago.
[42:58.980 --> 43:02.980]  He came back and had like 130 yards rushing his first game back.
[43:02.980 --> 43:03.980]  Good fantasy player.
[43:03.980 --> 43:06.980]  Rams, I think they're in the last playoff spot now.
[43:06.980 --> 43:07.980]  You have 7-7.
[43:07.980 --> 43:10.980]  7-7, the AFC is wide open.
[43:10.980 --> 43:12.980]  That's what's keeping an eye on.
[43:12.980 --> 43:14.980]  There's like the Bills are 8-6.
[43:14.980 --> 43:16.980]  You got the Chiefs at 9-5.
[43:16.980 --> 43:17.980]  Bronco 7-7.
[43:17.980 --> 43:18.980]  Browns 9-5.
[43:18.980 --> 43:19.980]  Bengals 8-6.
[43:19.980 --> 43:22.980]  Colts, Jags, and Texans all 8-6.
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.560]  have I mean, just based on the attendance, interest, the general engagement compared to
[46:50.560 --> 46:55.200]  all the other. Yeah, the fact that we have no other football. Yeah, like Vegas, I would assume
[46:55.200 --> 47:00.400]  Seattle, Houston, yeah, why are those people at least been interested in? Yeah, I can't imagine
[47:00.400 --> 47:03.760]  that they would be. I thought they announced last week that St. Louis is one of the teams that are
[47:04.640 --> 47:10.560]  staying in the XFL. I this is an article from front office sports, and it was updated this
[43:22.980 --> 43:25.980]  Real jockeying for possession going on these last couple weeks.
[43:25.980 --> 43:29.980]  I think a lot of people thought that both the Chiefs and the Bills would beat dynamite teams this year.
[43:29.980 --> 43:32.980]  And they're both not near as good as what they were projecting.
[43:32.980 --> 43:34.980]  A terrible receiving core on both teams.
[43:34.980 --> 43:35.980]  Oh, the Bills.
[43:35.980 --> 43:36.980]  Duncan Cade, I guess.
[43:36.980 --> 43:37.980]  Well, Steph and Dave.
[43:37.980 --> 43:38.980]  Steph's digs.
[43:38.980 --> 43:39.980]  Yeah.
[43:39.980 --> 43:42.980]  Every game the Bills have lost, they've lost by less than a one score.
[43:42.980 --> 43:45.980]  In every game they won, they're winning by like 20 points a game.
[43:45.980 --> 43:46.980]  I'm with Aggie.
[43:46.980 --> 43:48.980]  I think that they're going to get right in the major.
[43:48.980 --> 43:51.980]  I mean, they looked really good last week against the Cowboys.
[47:10.560 --> 47:18.240]  morning. Just 20 minutes ago. So this is what I'm seeing right now in terms of the future of
[47:18.240 --> 47:23.040]  spring football. So yeah, like Doug said, I would think that the battle Hawks would be safe.
[47:24.480 --> 47:27.840]  Semi pro to where the best four teams made it.
[47:29.360 --> 47:34.000]  The problem with eliminating some of those other bigger cities that have teams is you also eliminate
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.040]  their TV markets, right, which has got a lot to do with how much money stadiums are empty,
[43:51.980 --> 43:55.980]  They smoked them, and the Cowboys have obviously been one of the better teams in the NFC
[43:55.980 --> 44:01.980]  as they are sitting at 10-4, tied with the Eagles now for second place in the NFC overall.
[44:01.980 --> 44:03.980]  The Niners, of course, at 11-3.
[44:03.980 --> 44:05.980]  So there's a little NFL breakdown for you.
[44:05.980 --> 44:07.980]  I know these people were clamoring for it.
[44:07.980 --> 44:08.980]  They were.
[44:08.980 --> 44:12.980]  But I just wanted to mention because there's obviously plenty of stuff going on there.
[44:12.980 --> 44:15.980]  And you can bet on all of it with the Circa Sports app.
[44:15.980 --> 44:17.980]  The world's largest sports book in Las Vegas is now in Illinois.
[44:17.980 --> 44:20.980]  The Circa Sports app is sports betting the way it should be.
[47:39.040 --> 47:43.200]  though. So like stadiums are empty, but you can't sell to national advertisers if you're not going
[47:43.200 --> 47:49.760]  to reach a big part of the nation and the USFL played all of their games in Birmingham. So I mean,
[47:49.760 --> 47:56.640]  you're not much in terms of but so like, let's say you did only keep the four non NFL cities in New
[47:56.640 --> 48:02.080]  York and LA still in there. So in the new when they relaunched when the rock took over and relaunched,
[48:02.080 --> 48:07.360]  I think they eliminated some of those teams. But so like, if you kept non NFL teams,
[48:08.320 --> 48:13.440]  like non NFL cities, you would have Arlington, Orlando, but our land is right smack, right
[48:13.440 --> 48:19.040]  on his right next to Dallas. Yeah, no doubt. Arlington, Orlando, St. Louis and San Antonio
[48:19.040 --> 48:23.520]  would be your four cities. San Antonio, I mean, this is but you can reach happen into Texas,
[48:23.520 --> 48:29.680]  obviously, because of 14 League. No, 18. So they're merging with the USFL, which Jeff Fisher was
[48:29.680 --> 48:34.720]  coaching the Michigan Panthers, both fallen and raised remember when the USFL was actually popular?
[44:20.980 --> 44:24.980]  Big app bets, high betting limits, tight money line splits, and the best customer service around.
[44:24.980 --> 44:27.980]  They're not going to start limiting you if you start winning with Circa.
[44:27.980 --> 44:28.980]  It's not what they do.
[44:28.980 --> 44:31.980]  And if you ever run into any issues with it, you talk to a real person, not a chatbot,
[44:31.980 --> 44:36.980]  over at the Circa Sports app, as I just mentioned, the NFL has plenty of games this weekend,
[44:36.980 --> 44:37.980]  bowl games left and right.
[44:37.980 --> 44:38.980]  You've got college hoops.
[44:38.980 --> 44:39.980]  You've got the NBA.
[44:39.980 --> 44:40.980]  You've got the NHL.
[44:40.980 --> 44:46.980]  So much to wager on right now over at the Circa Sports app, which is now available in Illinois.
[44:46.980 --> 44:48.980]  So visit CircaSports.com for more details.
[48:34.720 --> 48:41.120]  Yeah. And it fell was losing first round draft picks the USFL. I think Jim Kelly played in there,
[48:41.120 --> 48:45.200]  I think. Young played in it. Herschel Walker play there for a while flute.
[48:46.320 --> 48:49.920]  Guys, will they play all their games in one location or play games in the host cities?
[48:49.920 --> 48:55.600]  For my first impression of this article, it seems like we're in the infancy of our
[48:55.600 --> 49:00.160]  this of this new entity, you would have to play in the home cities. Otherwise, it's not a,
[44:48.980 --> 44:52.980]  And get ready to start betting like a pro if you or someone you know may have a problem with gambling.
[44:52.980 --> 44:57.980]  Call 1-800-GAMBLER or text ILGAMB to 833234.
[44:57.980 --> 45:01.980]  Doug, we were talking about what to get people for the holidays.
[45:01.980 --> 45:05.980]  But if you have a dog, there's one gift that you for sure should get, and that's naturals.
[45:05.980 --> 45:06.980]  That's exactly right.
[45:06.980 --> 45:07.980]  Don't forget your dogs.
[45:07.980 --> 45:10.980]  And when Dora sits around the Christmas tree with us, she's going to want something.
[45:10.980 --> 45:14.980]  And if you want to open up a package just like this one that I'm holding up on YouTube right now,
[45:14.980 --> 45:16.980]  look at that nice green packaging.
[49:00.800 --> 49:05.840]  it's not a real league, is it? Yeah, I supposed to root for a St. Louis team playing games in
[49:05.840 --> 49:11.280]  Antonio. Won't work. No point in that. Like there's one thing, it's one thing not to practice here.
[49:11.280 --> 49:15.840]  It's another thing to not play the actual games here. And they have men's league teams
[49:15.840 --> 49:19.680]  playing in other cities, but they don't name one of them St. Louis and claim we're supposed to be
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.560]  interested in it. Yeah. I don't know. I just I personally, I don't have the appetite for
[45:16.980 --> 45:17.980]  Naturals.
[45:17.980 --> 45:19.980]  And the treats are just fabulous.
[45:19.980 --> 45:21.980]  Can I have a bag over there I can have for my niece's dog?
[45:21.980 --> 45:22.980]  No, I should know.
[45:22.980 --> 45:23.980]  I have one right here that I need to show people.
[45:23.980 --> 45:24.980]  Naturals.com.
[45:24.980 --> 45:25.980]  And this is what's in there.
[45:25.980 --> 45:27.980]  This is a chicken-flavored ribbed bone.
[45:27.980 --> 45:28.980]  Boy, it looks good.
[45:28.980 --> 45:29.980]  It's so shiny.
[45:29.980 --> 45:30.980]  It's like something a human might want to know.
[45:30.980 --> 45:31.980]  Yeah, I get into that.
[45:31.980 --> 45:35.980]  And Dora loves those, and her cousin Elway just really goes nuts over them.
[45:35.980 --> 45:36.980]  And your dog will like them too.
[45:36.980 --> 45:37.980]  So get your dog something.
[45:37.980 --> 45:40.980]  Even if you miss Christmas, you know, they're still going to know.
[45:40.980 --> 45:41.980]  They're not going to know.
[45:41.980 --> 45:42.980]  So you might as well go ahead and buy them.
[49:24.560 --> 49:29.600]  spring pro football. It is the last one year this now I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, this isn't a joke.
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.880]  This will last one year this and then it'll, it'll be done. It's Holly Saunders,
[49:34.880 --> 49:39.920]  broad panties league playing anywhere. I beg your pardon, huh? I think Holly Saunders started a
[49:40.560 --> 49:46.080]  lingerie league. That's not bad. Well, they had that a few years ago. Yeah, but with Holly Saunders
[49:46.080 --> 49:53.840]  and, uh, it was one guy who owned all the teams. I forgot what she called. She was all over promoting.
[45:43.980 --> 45:45.980]  But for sure, you want to support the local sponsors
[45:45.980 --> 45:47.980]  and support longtime TMA listeners.
[45:47.980 --> 45:48.980]  They're a family-owned business.
[45:48.980 --> 45:51.980]  They want to provide your dog top-quality dog treats,
[45:51.980 --> 45:52.980]  and they've done just that.
[45:52.980 --> 45:56.980]  Naturals carries a lineup of limited ingredient dental chews,
[45:56.980 --> 46:00.980]  100% rawhide-free options, and mouth-watering oven-baked cookies.
[46:00.980 --> 46:02.980]  Your dog's tail will be wagging with excitement
[46:02.980 --> 46:06.980]  after tasting flavors like real peanut butter, chicken, and pumpkin.
[46:06.980 --> 46:08.980]  Your dog will be begging for more, just as Dora does.
[46:08.980 --> 46:09.980]  She begs a lot.
[46:09.980 --> 46:11.980]  Discounted variety packs also available
[49:53.840 --> 49:59.760]  Exposed sports. That's what Holly Saunders launches. Exposed sports, which is a nude sports
[49:59.760 --> 50:05.280]  league. A nude sports league. I'm reading an article here from the New York Post on June 1st,
[50:05.280 --> 50:11.680]  2023. I'm guessing it doesn't come to fruition. Probably not. Exposed sports which will include
[50:11.680 --> 50:16.640]  Instagram and only fans models participating in topless matches. Former golf channel and Fox
[50:16.640 --> 50:21.680]  sports host who's been dating hall of fame boxer Oscar Delahoya since August of 21 to launch the
[50:21.680 --> 50:27.760]  league in June. They're playing golf. This is naked golf. Uh, compete. They'll be competing
[50:27.760 --> 50:33.840]  in seven to eight sports and activities. What are these sports? I have no idea. This is the first
[50:33.840 --> 50:38.400]  I've ever heard of it until like you just brought it up. But it's a, it's a social media league.
[50:38.400 --> 50:43.120]  Thank I would be surprised if Disney and ESPN hopped on board with this one. Doesn't seem like,
[50:43.120 --> 50:45.840]  yeah, you ever see a picture of those two together? Who's had more work done?
[46:11.980 --> 46:15.980]  so your dog can enjoy all flavors delivered right to your door.
[46:15.980 --> 46:16.980]  And here's a treat for our listeners.

[46:25.980 --> 46:27.980]  Yes, I'm going to go ahead and spell it again.

[46:36.980 --> 46:40.980]  like this rib bone right there that they will absolutely love.
[50:46.560 --> 50:50.240]  Who you talking about? Oscar Delahoya and Holly Saunders.
[50:51.280 --> 50:57.200]  I haven't seen Oscar Delahoya since he was in his prime fighting. Well, he's all over the place now
[50:57.200 --> 51:01.120]  because he's always out with her. But they weren't event the other night. There's a picture of him.
[51:01.120 --> 51:05.920]  I said, my God, who's had more work done? He looks like he's got the face that doesn't move.
[51:06.880 --> 51:10.720]  I think I'm not sure I've seen anyone had more work done than Marlo Thomas.
[46:40.980 --> 46:41.980]  I'm sure they will.
[46:41.980 --> 46:42.980]  Naturals.
[46:42.980 --> 46:44.980]  Before we head to break here,
[46:44.980 --> 46:47.980]  KG sent some wonderful links this morning to me
[46:47.980 --> 46:52.980]  and one that hits close to home from a show gone by.
[46:52.980 --> 46:54.980]  It's called Biff and Show, Doug.
[46:54.980 --> 46:55.980]  Nice.
[46:55.980 --> 46:59.980]  Biff and Iggy would do what, afternoons on Fridays?
[46:59.980 --> 47:00.980]  I think so.
[47:00.980 --> 47:03.980]  Hopefully, there was like an ultimate frisbee game.
[47:03.980 --> 47:05.980]  You might get bumped, but other than that,
[47:05.980 --> 47:08.980]  you guys would be on even though Biff was paying for it.
[51:10.800 --> 51:16.960]  Have you seen her lately on commercials like for the St. Jude's Hospital? You wouldn't recognize her.
[51:16.960 --> 51:22.720]  Really? Yeah. Well, she is like 80. Yeah, I know. And God bless him for trying to stay
[51:22.720 --> 51:27.440]  young and do whatever it takes. But it's just odd when you don't even look the way.
[51:27.440 --> 51:30.000]  I think Marie Osman's had any work done because she is still gorgeous.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.840]  She is. Yeah. She is. Oh, I'm sure they've.
[51:33.840 --> 51:38.480]  Getting a bunch of texts here that I'm an idiot and that this is not new. This was announced in
[47:09.980 --> 47:11.980]  Sometimes I just sit from home.
[47:11.980 --> 47:12.980]  You feel like coming in.
[47:12.980 --> 47:13.980]  No, why didn't you feel like coming in?
[47:13.980 --> 47:14.980]  You're listening to us.
[47:14.980 --> 47:15.980]  That's terrible, huh?
[47:15.980 --> 47:16.980]  I'm on my couch.
[47:16.980 --> 47:18.980]  I'm just going to call in today a bit.
[47:18.980 --> 47:21.980]  Well, a big topic on that show, Doug, is you remember with splashing.
[47:21.980 --> 47:26.980]  And I got an article here from Metro.UK talking about splashing.
[47:26.980 --> 47:29.980]  There's no shame in indulging in any fetish as long as it's legal.
[47:29.980 --> 47:30.980]  So they don't kink shame.
[47:30.980 --> 47:31.980]  God bless.
[47:31.980 --> 47:33.980]  Well, they said as long as it's legal.
[47:33.980 --> 47:36.980]  So you can kink shame the illegal fetishes.
[47:36.980 --> 47:37.980]  And I agree on that.
[51:38.480 --> 51:42.960]  November playing in host cities. Real timely news. Season tickets been on sale since November.
[51:42.960 --> 51:47.200]  It's from a three on four. I was reading from the article that did not make any of that clear.
[51:47.920 --> 51:52.240]  I'm not tapped in. I apologize. Stephen Wildwood said I just bought season tickets last week.
[51:52.240 --> 51:57.280]  Battle Hawks are in. All right. Well, then it's settled. Yeah. A lot of us don't keep up with the
[51:58.480 --> 52:04.240]  XFL. I just saw the article. It looked interesting. So I popped it in. I did think I saw it last week
[47:37.980 --> 47:40.980]  I talked to a woman on Fremont Street, as KG remembers,
[47:40.980 --> 47:43.980]  who talked about as long as kink shaming, everything's legal.
[47:43.980 --> 47:47.980]  Then no need to kink shame before she told me that she knows exactly what a cuckold is.
[47:47.980 --> 47:49.980]  There's no shame in indulging in any fetish,
[47:49.980 --> 47:54.980]  but this sex trend will leave you unable to look at spaghetti bolognese the same ever again.
[47:54.980 --> 47:56.980]  Splashing during sex is as messy as it sounds.
[47:56.980 --> 47:59.980]  And it may leave you finding pasta sauce in your privates for a week or two.
[47:59.980 --> 48:01.980]  So a good shower after is key.
[48:01.980 --> 48:02.980]  That's a nice little tidbit.
[48:02.980 --> 48:04.980]  Thanks for the help.
[52:04.400 --> 52:08.320]  with St. Louis is in. All right. Yeah, there we go. I think it could be viable if you get in the right
[52:08.320 --> 52:12.880]  cities and St. Louis is one of the right cities. We've got nothing else. What is St. Louis? I mean,
[52:12.880 --> 52:17.440]  it's owned by The Rock. It's owned by one group, right? Yep. So, I mean,
[52:19.760 --> 52:24.400]  St. Louis has no really no stake. They don't care. I mean, they get to go see football,
[52:24.400 --> 52:31.760]  but nobody in that city is making any money. Well, the people that I guess run the restaurants and
[48:04.980 --> 48:10.980]  This flosh is to derive sexual pleasure and arousal from being covered in wet and messy substances
[48:10.980 --> 48:12.980]  like food products and beverages.
[48:12.980 --> 48:15.980]  And we are talking a little sexy squirt of whipped cream.
[48:15.980 --> 48:18.980]  Think of baths of jelly and maple syrup all over.
[48:18.980 --> 48:20.980]  Oh, that sounds terrible.
[48:20.980 --> 48:24.980]  As its alternative name, wham, wet and messy would suggest.
[48:24.980 --> 48:29.980]  The thought of slimy, sticky feeling that will inevitably come from giving this kink may go make you cringe,
[48:29.980 --> 48:33.980]  but the fetish is booming in popularity with over 11 million views on TikTok,
[52:31.760 --> 52:35.760]  the parking garages and the dome stadium and those people make money. The people that go to work
[52:35.760 --> 52:40.560]  there for the games. Yeah, but I'm saying they didn't make any money. There's no cranky owned
[52:40.560 --> 52:45.360]  it either, did it? But I'm saying there's no St. Louis entity that's involved in this. That's
[52:45.360 --> 52:52.080]  got a stake in it. Right. So it doesn't matter. I mean, it's up to Rock and whoever else is running
[52:52.080 --> 53:00.160]  this thing as far as players and right trades and things like that. All these crazy alien stories
[48:33.980 --> 48:37.980]  video show women pouring spaghetti over themselves,
[48:37.980 --> 48:41.980]  sitting in a cake and jelly and showering themselves in sauce or coffee.
[48:41.980 --> 48:42.980]  I don't get it.
[48:42.980 --> 48:51.980]  Sex psychotherapist Gigi Angle for sex toys dot co dot UK tells Metro that splashing is mainly about getting wet and messy,
[48:51.980 --> 48:54.980]  but using food is an incredibly popular offshoot for the fetish.
[48:54.980 --> 49:02.980]  She says splashing is a sexual kink or fetish that involves sitting in or spreading around jelly like or viscous substances.
[49:03.980 --> 49:08.980]  But it can encompass absolutely any substance that gets messy and Gigi says cake sitting is hugely popular.
[49:08.980 --> 49:10.980]  Wasn't that what Biff was into?
[49:10.980 --> 49:12.980]  They like them to sit on the cake.
[49:12.980 --> 49:16.980]  Yeah, that and some kind of.
[49:16.980 --> 49:22.980]  And then the girls, the pornsters always say be careful of that because you don't want that up you.
[49:22.980 --> 49:27.980]  Certain things like sugar and yeast and things like that, these infections.
[53:00.160 --> 53:05.040]  can't be true, can they? Hey, it's Steven Deener hosted the Unidentified Alien Podcast. And whether
[53:05.040 --> 53:08.800]  you're new to the conversation or have been looking into it for years, you need to check out

[53:14.080 --> 53:18.400]  There's a crazy amount of alien encounter stories out there from all over the world. And the beauty
[53:18.400 --> 53:22.880]  of it is that I bring them all to you and that you decide what you believe. Download and subscribe

[49:28.980 --> 49:35.980]  Countess Diamond, the dominatrix explains to Metro that code that UK that splashing or WAM is a big part of the BDSM culture,
[49:35.980 --> 49:37.980]  and she has a pretty good idea of where it came from.
[49:37.980 --> 49:42.980]  She says when splashing first occurred in our history, I don't know for sure, but the earliest.
[49:42.980 --> 49:43.980]  It's unbelievable.
[49:43.980 --> 49:49.980]  But the earliest record show grapes being crushed under feet for wine was in 7000 B.C.
[49:49.980 --> 49:54.980]  And I have a feeling someone would have been watching those women with a semi in their pants.
[49:54.980 --> 49:55.980]  Oh, come on.
[53:30.240 --> 53:34.880]  Well, the quality of play wasn't bad. I mean, they had a backup quarterback going to be a starter in
[53:34.880 --> 53:41.280]  the NFL. The battle Hawks did. So obviously the talent is just half a notch beneath the NFL.
[53:41.280 --> 53:47.520]  Drawing 30,000. And we can't have one team in your entire league draw 30,000 when I'm drawing 12.
[53:47.520 --> 53:51.760]  Like that's why like St. Louis, I'm not saying St. Louis doesn't support. It's amazing. I've
[53:51.760 --> 53:58.640]  been to two games. It's unbelievable. But you cannot have one team in one minor city
[53:58.640 --> 54:03.280]  hold an entire league up and justify the expenses. I'm sure Rock and his ownership
[54:03.280 --> 54:07.520]  group are putting into this. And if they don't point in St. Louis, then this league is definitely
[54:07.520 --> 54:13.760]  done. Like if they pick one host city like USL felt it is done. It is officially done. You will
[54:13.760 --> 54:19.200]  get no support from the fan base. It's like the Tiger Woods Golf League. It's like you got them
[54:19.200 --> 54:24.480]  like sponsored by Boston Common, but they're playing in West Palm Beach. I never understood
[49:55.980 --> 49:57.980]  7000 B.C.
[49:57.980 --> 49:58.980]  That's what it contracts.
[49:58.980 --> 49:59.980]  Flashing.
[49:59.980 --> 50:00.980]  They even have last names and they were into it.
[50:00.980 --> 50:01.980]  I wasn't splashing.
[50:01.980 --> 50:04.980]  That was just you're making wine.
[50:04.980 --> 50:06.980]  That's pretty close to caveman era, isn't it?
[50:06.980 --> 50:08.980]  7000 B.C.
[50:08.980 --> 50:09.980]  Probably, yeah.
[50:09.980 --> 50:11.980]  Yeah, I mean, caveman there is probably really long.
[50:11.980 --> 50:15.980]  All the delightful squishing noises and giggling as it tickled their toes.
[50:15.980 --> 50:16.980]  I can see how this could be erotic.
[50:16.980 --> 50:21.980]  Drinking wine out of an orifice, which is probably considered pretty tame by Roman standards,
[50:21.980 --> 50:27.980]  but it goes back to your Roman gay sex slave story, Iggy, that you mentioned a week or two ago.
[50:27.980 --> 50:28.980]  You could verify that.
[50:28.980 --> 50:33.980]  You can't verify something happened 7000 years ago just because you say that I guess that
[50:33.980 --> 50:35.980]  bear I guarantee you they had semis.
[50:35.980 --> 50:37.980]  You're going to count that as splashing.
[50:37.980 --> 50:41.980]  Well, you're the one just saying you want to know who that the last name first last name.
[50:41.980 --> 50:43.980]  We probably have to go back to 7000 B.C.
[50:43.980 --> 50:48.980]  Not forgetting the Egyptians had Queen Cleopatra, who frequently bathed in milk.
[54:24.480 --> 54:29.200]  that. And I think this would be the same thing. It's like you put a slap a city on it, but they're
[54:29.200 --> 54:34.240]  playing in Arlington. That would be a joke. I think that's why it wasn't as great the second
[54:34.240 --> 54:37.760]  time around because the first go around with the battle Hawks. They were in town all week. They
[54:37.760 --> 54:41.840]  were out in the community building that fan base. But then when they weren't based here, it was like
[54:41.840 --> 54:45.280]  you couldn't connect with the team in any way. They just came in and played a game and left like
[54:45.280 --> 54:49.600]  everybody does in St. Louis and leave it quickly if they can. That has just be a cost cutting
[54:49.680 --> 54:53.440]  measure. Oh, yeah, of course. Absolutely. They buy one training facility instead of
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.840]  having to build 10 of them. That's the problem with having one person own it and not owned by
[54:57.840 --> 55:05.760]  local people. Because our good buddy Brian Stahl was a PR for the except for St. Louis. It was hard
[55:05.760 --> 55:10.480]  for him the second year trying to promote these guys and they're all out of town. You know, he
[55:10.480 --> 55:14.080]  did a hell of a job the first year. He's got them all over the place at hospitals, at schools and
[55:14.080 --> 55:18.240]  all over the place promoting it. But how you promote them when they're all out of town. You have to do
[50:48.980 --> 50:52.980]  Well, the site to behold that must have been the opaque white layer swirling across her body,
[50:52.980 --> 50:53.980]  dripping off her fingertips.
[50:53.980 --> 50:55.980]  Boy, this is getting ha ha ha.
[50:55.980 --> 50:56.980]  It's not that hot.
[50:56.980 --> 51:00.980]  I mean, she did that, but you're going to count that slop splashing too?
[51:00.980 --> 51:02.980]  I guess it's splashing family.
[51:02.980 --> 51:03.980]  Sure.
[51:03.980 --> 51:08.980]  What about James Cagney threw the grapefruit in her face in public enemy?
[51:08.980 --> 51:09.980]  Is that splashing?
[51:09.980 --> 51:10.980]  I don't think so.
[51:10.980 --> 51:13.980]  Like if you throw a tomato at a bad comedian, that's not splashing.
[51:13.980 --> 51:14.980]  According to this people there.
[51:14.980 --> 51:17.980]  What food would you guys take into the bedroom?
[55:18.240 --> 55:23.680]  it via Zoom or something now. Social media, I guess. Just because 15,000 Kyles from Jeffco,
[55:23.680 --> 55:28.080]  dressed like a bird, does not make the XFL cool. That comes from a Malaga to Kiel listener of the
[55:28.080 --> 55:32.800]  month, I think for the month of May. Well, it made it viable in St. Louis anyway. There are more people
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.560]  dressed up in that stadium than not. Wearing normal clothes, you're like the minority there.
[55:38.560 --> 55:42.560]  It's like a Halloween costume during those games. It's insane. It looks like you're at a Halloween
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.280]  show. Go ahead and leave Jeffco out of it though. St. Louis needs a pointless bowl game. We have
[51:17.980 --> 51:19.980]  George stands or brought pastrami.
[51:19.980 --> 51:20.980]  Yeah, nice.
[51:20.980 --> 51:21.980]  Nice roast beef sandwich.
[51:21.980 --> 51:22.980]  It's the most cheese.
[51:22.980 --> 51:24.980]  Essential of all the salted meats.
[51:24.980 --> 51:25.980]  I'm going peanut butter.
[51:25.980 --> 51:28.980]  Yeah, there's a thought there.
[51:28.980 --> 51:29.980]  A little messy.
[51:29.980 --> 51:31.980]  Doug, I feel like you'd have a good time.
[51:31.980 --> 51:33.980]  A pimento cheese sandwich.
[51:33.980 --> 51:34.980]  Salty and crackers.
[51:34.980 --> 51:37.980]  Well, you can always eat a peanut butter mayonnaise sandwich.
[51:37.980 --> 51:39.980]  Can of tuna fish right by the bed.
[51:39.980 --> 51:41.980]  Just get a fork in there.
[51:41.980 --> 51:43.980]  For so many reasons.
[51:43.980 --> 51:44.980]  Yeah, no, thank you.
[51:44.980 --> 51:45.980]  A pimento cheese sandwich.
[55:47.280 --> 55:51.200]  nothing to do with this time of year and could sell 30,000 tickets to locals. That's from Hunchback
[55:51.200 --> 55:55.840]  of on Castle. I think the XFL and the soccer stadium would probably be an interesting look,
[55:55.840 --> 56:00.240]  be a good place to play. You'd probably pack that stadium. It would be they would fill it up.
[56:01.760 --> 56:04.080]  I am kind of surprised all the useless stuff the city gets.
[56:05.680 --> 56:10.560]  Why they've never gone after trying to get a bowl game. I'm guessing nobody wants to come here for
[56:10.560 --> 56:14.560]  a bowl game. Maybe they have. Maybe the sports commission has and I just haven't heard. I think
[51:45.980 --> 51:46.980]  Those are one of your favorites.
[51:46.980 --> 51:47.980]  No, I don't care for them.
[51:47.980 --> 51:50.980]  Even though they're inexpensive at the Masters, I know.
[51:50.980 --> 51:51.980]  I still don't like them.
[51:51.980 --> 51:54.980]  Yeah, PB and mayonnaise would probably be pretty good.
[51:54.980 --> 51:56.980]  Why are we talking about porn?
[51:56.980 --> 51:57.980]  That's from Wolfboy.
[51:57.980 --> 51:59.980]  Well, the show never does that.
[51:59.980 --> 52:01.980]  Hey, Grandpa Vaughn, the Bengals are the best team ever.
[52:01.980 --> 52:02.980]  I have the best wean ever.
[52:02.980 --> 52:03.980]  Make milky on my white.
[52:03.980 --> 52:05.980]  Nope, I don't think I can finish that.
[52:05.980 --> 52:06.980]  Is that the recovery in alcohol?
[52:06.980 --> 52:07.980]  Yeah, you want to suspend them?
[52:07.980 --> 52:08.980]  I would like to.
[52:08.980 --> 52:13.980]  The recovery in alcoholic from Belleville has indeed been suspended again for his comments, I mean.
[56:14.560 --> 56:20.080]  the dome is so it's I don't even know if it's viable for that sort of thing. Look at how
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.880]  terrible Mizzou like Mizzou remember the complaint, remember the field conditions like
[56:24.880 --> 56:29.200]  that that dome is never going to be tip-top shaped ready for a football game year in and year out.
[56:29.200 --> 56:34.480]  I just it looks so bad against that. On TV it's so unappealing on television. This city has the
[56:34.480 --> 56:39.840]  infrastructure in terms of hotels around the area but there's nothing to do downtown. And because of
[52:14.980 --> 52:19.980]  He's been suspended a period of two days' time, and his name, as we speak, is going into the suspension logule.
[52:19.980 --> 52:22.980]  He could be the last suspension of the year.
[52:22.980 --> 52:24.980]  Certainly hope so.
[52:24.980 --> 52:26.980]  Ham, chunks, and cheese dip, right?
[52:26.980 --> 52:28.980]  Plowsie with a little milk to wash it down.
[52:28.980 --> 52:29.980]  It's from Gary Pinkle's cell phone.
[52:29.980 --> 52:32.980]  You eat in bed, but I feel like it's different than the splashing story.
[52:32.980 --> 52:37.980]  Yeah, ham with queso is actually a very underrated and super unhealthy, I would assume, dish.
[52:37.980 --> 52:39.980]  You have to do it when Gossip Girl's on.
[52:39.980 --> 52:42.980]  Yeah, we're actually, sadly, we've finished that up.
[56:39.920 --> 56:44.480]  what's happened there's you get such a negative vibe when you walk into that dome like this is
[56:44.480 --> 56:52.240]  where the NFL died. You can smell the mold. Whatever dome whatever area is selling RC Cola.
[56:52.240 --> 56:58.640]  You walk the other way bro. I'm sorry. If they can't afford Coca-Cola you know when you walk in
[56:58.640 --> 57:04.800]  where they got RC Cola. That's what they do. Going to the Mizzou Memphis game I hadn't been
[52:42.980 --> 52:47.980]  And sadly, we're only three episodes away from finishing up Gilmore Girls again.
[52:47.980 --> 52:52.980]  But I know they have, I think, a movie or that new show Gilmore Girls.
[52:52.980 --> 52:55.980]  It's like for a season when it's all the same character as older now.
[52:55.980 --> 52:57.980]  So I'm going to dive into that afterward.
[52:57.980 --> 53:03.980]  But it is kind of depressing when you're, you know, on your last couple episodes of a five or six season show,
[53:03.980 --> 53:06.980]  you've been running through it for the third time.
[53:06.980 --> 53:09.980]  Gosh, don't you know all the dialogue by now?
[53:09.980 --> 53:11.980]  Almost, you could do one of the speaking parts.
[57:04.800 --> 57:12.880]  to the dome since I saw one Sean Carter Jay-Z at the Rams game last Rams game I went to against
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.800]  the Lions. That was the last time I was in the dome and walking back in there it was just brutal.
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.920]  It's just like oh man so many wasted men and it's dark like other concourses are like dark
[57:23.920 --> 57:29.920]  like you can't see anything. The field sucks. We make fun of like the Duke's Mayo Bowl and going
[53:11.980 --> 53:13.980]  This is, it's very emotional.
[53:13.980 --> 53:18.980]  I forgot about, you know, Rory and Logan Hunsberger, the ups and downs of their relationship towards the end of the year.
[53:18.980 --> 53:24.980]  You know, Richard and Emily, you know, Richard had that heart attack, but he don't want to go to work at the insurance company.
[53:24.980 --> 53:27.980]  Yeah, I've been watching the Tudors for like the third time.
[53:27.980 --> 53:29.980]  Tudor's in good.
[53:29.980 --> 53:30.980]  It's a good show.
[53:30.980 --> 53:38.980]  At the end of season one, Rory finally got rid of his wife Catherine, and now he's starting to hook up with Ambalyn.
[57:29.920 --> 57:36.560]  to like you know like all these podon quote unquote places but like if we really internalize
[57:36.560 --> 57:40.640]  it like those places are light years that they have outdoor stadiums. It obviously looks good.
[57:40.640 --> 57:44.800]  They got infrastructure to support it. It's not like an absolute murder scene like two blocks
[57:44.800 --> 57:49.040]  away from your stadium. They still do things in there. I think they had auto racing in there last
[57:49.040 --> 57:54.480]  week. Oh yeah they they do a lot of events there. It's not like it's you know empty the entire year
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.320]  so I give them credit for that. I think they had the bull riding there a couple weeks ago. Yeah and it's
[53:39.980 --> 53:42.980]  Did they call it hooking up back then?
[53:42.980 --> 53:44.980]  Ambalyn, there's a last name. She had a last name.
[53:44.980 --> 53:46.980]  Is that Jonathan Rees-Myers in that?
[53:46.980 --> 53:49.980]  Yep. Great role for him too.
[53:49.980 --> 53:53.980]  And this is the guy you want to play your story in the Iggy movie.
[53:53.980 --> 53:57.980]  He's buff. Right? That we're looking for?
[53:57.980 --> 54:01.980]  Yeah, he's had some drinking problems in the past. He's been in rehab a few times.
[54:01.980 --> 54:04.980]  But he'll play, he'll portray you. He'll bring the truth to the role.
[57:58.320 --> 58:03.280]  perfect for those type of event. Monster truck rallies. Yeah you don't need a little riding.
[58:04.240 --> 58:08.320]  Doug wouldn't know this because you were always in the main press box. I was stuck in the auxiliary
[58:08.320 --> 58:12.640]  press box for games. There were times I would walk in the auxiliary press box and have to turn the
[58:12.640 --> 58:18.720]  flashlight on on my phone to look where I was going. I mean you couldn't see. It was it was like
[58:18.720 --> 58:23.760]  a dimly lit restaurant. It was like that from day one. The first day had opened we said turn
[58:23.760 --> 58:28.080]  the lights on here. Remember when they would introduce the Rams before a game and turn off
[54:04.980 --> 54:07.980]  Good actor though, and he's a good looking dude.
[54:07.980 --> 54:11.980]  Well, that's not who we need to play you.
[54:11.980 --> 54:17.980]  You know what's depressing? A quote-unquote grown boy watching Gilmore Girls for the fourth time.
[54:17.980 --> 54:20.980]  That's from Mr. Siders. Are you a Sex and the City guy?
[54:20.980 --> 54:22.980]  Yeah, I never got into it.
[54:22.980 --> 54:24.980]  It seems like it'd be right up your alley if you're like Gilmore Girls.
[54:24.980 --> 54:31.980]  Because, I mean, in Gilded Age, I love Miranda is obviously Ada in Gilded Age, who I love.
[58:28.080 --> 58:32.640]  all the lights in the building and I thought I hope nobody gets hurt running on the field. I
[58:32.640 --> 58:38.880]  can't see. So starting at defensive end Chris Long where is he? He's running on the field. I
[58:38.880 --> 58:44.080]  can't see him. You know he spit the water. That was Lauren Nitus because of his father. Chris Long
[58:44.080 --> 58:48.800]  always talks about the yellow light bulbs at the at the dome. He goes yellow light bulbs at the
[58:48.800 --> 58:54.320]  dome. Couldn't see a thing. No. I can't. Who thought of that? Like aesthetically pleasing. It's one of
[54:31.980 --> 54:35.980]  She's one of my favorite characters, and she is in Sex and the City kind of into her prime.
[54:35.980 --> 54:40.980]  So I think I could see myself enjoying the character arcs for each one.
[54:40.980 --> 54:42.980]  Well, I like a nice character arc.
[54:42.980 --> 54:43.980]  Don't say character arc.
[54:43.980 --> 54:44.980]  I really like a nice character arc.
[54:44.980 --> 54:46.980]  Who do you think you are to say something like that?
[54:46.980 --> 54:50.980]  I knew you'd get a kick out of it, Doug. I thought you'd like a character arc.
[54:50.980 --> 54:56.980]  I would love to eat some peal and each shrimp off of Doug's inner thigh. Doug, that's from Pumpernickel Pickle.
[54:56.980 --> 54:57.980]  Oh.
[54:57.980 --> 54:58.980]  I just read it.
[54:58.980 --> 54:59.980]  Oh, yeah, I read it. I see.
[58:54.320 --> 58:59.920]  the least aesthetically pleasing stadiums that may have ever been built in the last 40 years.
[58:59.920 --> 59:06.640]  Did nature okay build that? Oh I hope not. I think they did. I think they did. I just don't
[59:06.640 --> 59:11.280]  I just don't know if a dome was necessary either. Does St. Louis get mounds of snow?
[59:12.080 --> 59:16.800]  I thought an open air stadium might have been. Always better. It's always better. I think it's
[59:16.800 --> 59:20.560]  better. You get the natural sunlight. I think it was all part of the convention center and they
[59:20.640 --> 59:25.440]  had to make sure it was available year-round regardless of the weather. Dome stadiums in
[59:25.440 --> 59:31.360]  general like New Orleans it sucks. It looks bad like it's just like what they've done in Atlanta
[59:31.360 --> 59:36.560]  or Minnesota with like the clear top the retractable roof stuff that's fine. Retractable is great.
[59:36.560 --> 59:40.960]  It's great. It's the best of both worlds. It is. I still like the open air better but I completely
[59:40.960 --> 59:46.480]  understand why retractable is obviously the move but. But you get open air. Just open the damn thing
[55:00.980 --> 55:03.980]  Doug, we're going to close out the...
[55:03.980 --> 55:04.980]  Probably a good idea.
[55:04.980 --> 55:10.980]  On that note, the one I just saw in the text in the box, we're going to close out the 8 o'clock hour here on the morning after,
[55:10.980 --> 55:13.980]  which is of course presented to you by Brown and Crouppen.
[55:13.980 --> 55:15.980]  We are broadcasting live from the Mickle and Bolter Studios.
[55:15.980 --> 55:18.980]  On the other side of the break, we'll have the Design Air Heating and Cooling email today.
[55:18.980 --> 55:23.980]  And so many other high jinks and little news and nuggets will just be so darling together.
[55:23.980 --> 55:28.980]  And you can join us all involved in that and get involved for the Design Air Heating and Cooling email today.
[55:28.980 --> 55:30.980]  We'll get to you on the other side of the break.
[55:30.980 --> 55:33.980]  This is the morning after presented to you by Brown and Crouppen live from the Mickle and Bolter Studios.

[59:46.480 --> 59:52.480]  up. Yeah. Open air. Yeah but that's like the completely open like Lambeau Field like it wouldn't
[59:52.480 --> 59:57.520]  be I mean it's obviously historically super important but part of the award to it is that
[59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.920]  it's open air and that you're going to get the conditions. You're going to get those conditions.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.880]  By the way have you seen that house that's for sale by Lambeau Field? Yeah I've seen a couple of
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.960]  I don't know if I've seen that particular one but me and Madison will always go on there and find
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.880]  some and it's insane. It's in the like it's in the parking lot basically. You could you that house
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:22.480]  would print money if you if you offered parking. 700,000 they were asking for. You could turn that
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:28.640]  around in 10 years. A lot of those are Airbnb specifically like Packer decorated and some more
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.200]  like you know got the huge patio set up with like grills and awnings like completely set up for like
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.760]  a 20 person like party. What do you think you can charge for? They make an absolute killing during
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.640]  football season. What could you make for an Airbnb there for a Packer? Oh if you got two days four
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:50.080]  bedrooms. So probably 250 a person because they would provide they provide a lot of things.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:58.160]  Wait like 250 a night or 250 a night per person. Oh yeah probably more than that. Oh my god you can
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:04.640]  walk to the stadium. Yeah proximity. So you're talking maybe sleeping eight that's 16. But
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.120]  you're only paying for how many like people they allow. That's almost two that's over 2009. I
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.320]  would be shocked. That'd be more like it. I would think yeah I would think so too. But if it's
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.320]  sweet take it's about two people. Because I don't think you care about people you just care what the
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.720]  money's coming in. Because if they sneak another person in or two you're not gonna know. That
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.000]  stadium's so crazy though because like how neighborhoody it is. Yeah like it's insane.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.200]  Really old school. Yeah you'll never find stadiums like that. You've been right? You've been the
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:34.240]  one. Yeah I've been four times. When was the last time you went? So the best. So it was right before
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.040]  I moved to St. Louis. I graduated college in December. I was a December graduate. So a week
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:45.840]  after graduation and a week before I was moving to St. Louis we went to Green Bay. And it was like
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:51.680]  negative five. We were attached to the casino so me and my boy did gambling wheel of forts and slots
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:58.000]  all night. The game got all messed up. Yeah and it was so cold we had the foot warmer the hand warmers.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.760]  But the tailgating you can go there on a completely empty stomach with nothing
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.840]  at all and walk around and get absolutely stuffed. People handing out beers. Yeah super cool. Oh
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:13.280]  someone never had here. Doug outside the dome because you've been working in media for so long.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.480]  What was the worst stadium that you can remember having to go cover a game at?
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.840]  Worst stadium outside of the dome. Uh gosh.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:32.000]  Uh. Do you ever do RFK? Uh no I did a new one there. Yeah. Shea Stadium was kind of a dump.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.440]  I've been there. Kind of. The old White Sox stadium was one of the worst too. Still that's still
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.600]  that's still the still the same one. Okay. Oh yeah they just changed names a bunch. I remember them
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:47.120]  telling you to like wear like neutral colors because of like it was so tense in like the mid
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.160]  the late 90s when I went to a Cardinal White Sox game it was it's like you couldn't wear like you
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.560]  know the the affiliated colors of certain neighborhoods. I know it's you'd have to go like
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.440]  neutral color. All my friends from most of my friends from Chicago are Sox fans and they say
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.880]  when you go to the the White Sox stadium you don't mess around outside you get inside the stadium
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.200]  and you watch the game. Right the neighborhood's bad but through our stadiums like like the Orange
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.760]  Bowl was kind of a dump but it was so historic. Yeah you can't help it like it wriggly feels that
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.360]  way. The seats are narrow the concourses the bathroom yeah troughs in there Fenway Park the
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.480]  seats are so narrow today's fat ass can barely sit in most of the seats. You get a lot more leeway if
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.240]  you have history. Right and those are some of the most historic stadiums. I want to go to Chavez
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.280]  Ravine so bad. Yeah my dad's the coolest thing. I don't really want to do the LA thing. I just don't
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.320]  think California is my style like a for a vacation depending on where it is but I would love to go to
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.760]  a game there because looking at it like at night kind of down there. Oh yeah very cool. All the old
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:51.040]  cookie cutters where it is the same. I may remember going to Riverfront Stadium. This is
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.080]  one of my ambush stadium. I mean they're all the same. Yeah there was a period there where
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.040]  cities built multiple U-stand. Candlestick Park was horrible in San Francisco. So I've heard
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.360]  nothing but that from people who've been there but the players who have played there say they
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.920]  love it because it's like it's just like a super classic football stadium. For football yeah for
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.520]  baseball it was horrible. Yeah anytime you're playing baseball in the football stadium you
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.840]  are you've lost. They say it may have cost Willie Mays like 20 home runs a year. I bet.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:21.440]  The wind that was howling in. I bet well I mean think of all the guys who like play at the poll
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.760]  grounds. You've seen the dimensions of the poll grounds. Ridiculous. Because it was a polo field.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:31.440]  Yeah absolutely. That's crazy. It was like 250 feet down the lines and 450 feet to sit or feel.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:39.440]  That's why that catch that catch was that Willie Mays made is unbelievable. He's running forever.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.320]  In the old Yankee Stadium Mickey Mantle probably would have had
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.960]  a longer career if it wasn't. Did he like trip over a drainage ditch or something?
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.240]  Yeah I wasn't 60. I don't know if that was was that true. I assume that they
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.920]  were pretty accurate in terms of I don't know about the hotel scene where you can
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.520]  you know drag it out by Whitey Ford or whoever it was. But that probably happened too.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.200]  Seems like Mickey and Joy are a wild party. Well I knew that but I didn't know how specific like
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.680]  the details of that those. You think Mickey Mantle and his prime ever got lucky in Manhattan.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:25.200]  Every every night. Like dude he's I've never watched him play just going based upon
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.600]  that story's personality like he would be one of my favorites. Yeah.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.240]  Just enjoying life. Didn't I give you the book the Mantle book. Yeah.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.720]  Yeah you want to read that that's that's his life. She did a great job of covering it but.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.320]  But when he was interviewed like late 90 I forgot right before he died you could tell how
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.840]  sad he was that his career kind of went the way it did because like you know when you party it's
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:55.040]  great in the moment and then looking back you're like oh I missed five years of my career. And he
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.600]  talked about that in depth which would suck there. There was a time he was not only like the best
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:05.040]  power hitter in the game. He was also the fastest runner. Yeah. He was like Bo Jackson in the 50s.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.560]  Yeah it's crazy. It's crazy. It's cool. He said many times that he said you know if I knew I was
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.560]  going to live this long I would have taken care of myself. He says every of my family has died by
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.200]  50. I just figured I'm going to be that way too. So I'm going to live it up. He said that's probably
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:25.840]  cost me five really great years of my career. Definitely. Get involved with the show. EDF Group

[01:03.680 --> 01:13.520]  Everybody's working for the weekend. Everybody wants a new home.
[01:13.520 --> 01:18.640]  Welcome back to the Morning After presented to you by Brown and Crouppen as we broadcast live
[00:51.040 --> 01:00.480]  Welcome back. Good morning, after. Presented by Mark Mil... Oops, I don't know why I said
[01:00.480 --> 01:05.680]  nice. I thought it was presented by Mark. Mark Mill just texted me and so I...
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.280]  Well, he helped present us for many years. And did you see that he took his wife to three
[01:09.280 --> 01:15.360]  different blue games, three different time zones. They were on the glass during the holidays.
[01:15.360 --> 01:18.640]  Loved me some milk. Really? Loved the Milton family. So you're giving them a show out?
[00:51.040 --> 00:57.680]  Where's Tim? What have you done with him? You are not Tim, you are some imposter sackass.
[00:57.680 --> 01:04.960]  Where is Tim? That's our co-worker. That's our co-worker. I am Tim. Okay.
[01:07.040 --> 01:12.880]  TMA. It clearly stands for Tim McKernan and Associates and he is not here. Yeah, that's
[01:12.880 --> 01:16.720]  kind of funny that that hasn't been mentioned yet, but that's actually what it means. It does mean
[01:18.640 --> 01:24.720]  from the Michelope Ultra Studios. Our final segment of the year 2023 as we are off all of next week,
[01:25.360 --> 01:30.240]  but best of programming will be running hot through your earlobes or your eardrums really,
[01:30.800 --> 01:36.320]  but running hot through your eardrums right now is our friend, the great Lisa Ann for her fantasy
[01:36.320 --> 01:42.080]  football Friday segment. Two part questions left and right. She's trying via the phones. Lisa Ann,
[01:16.800 --> 01:22.400]  that. Yeah, it's a secret. And we are nothing but Associates. Yeah, we're like a supporting
[01:22.400 --> 01:29.200]  cast. We just, we're here. We try our best. Yeah, that's what we're doing. Welcome to the
[01:29.200 --> 01:35.520]  morning after presented to you by Brown and Crouppen. This is the Mungenest, St. Louis Acura,
[01:35.520 --> 01:42.560]  Mungenest, Burcard, Altan, Toyota. Seven o'clock hour. How are you doing, Doug? Well, geez, I'm
[01:18.720 --> 01:23.040]  Taxman extraordinaire. Fantastic. But we are in fact presented by Brown and Crouppen,
[01:23.040 --> 01:27.920]  our lovely title sponsor. And we are in the Miqaloba Ultra Studios, bringing some heat here
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.280]  in the eight o'clock hour. Coming up on the presentation, Lisa Ann will join us at nine
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.600]  o'clock via the phone lines. You can send in your two-part questions to the EDF group.
[01:35.600 --> 01:42.080]  Text inbox, bring the heat, two-part questions will be the last time for 2023. You can ask Lisa Ann.
[01:42.080 --> 01:46.720]  Probably big playoff implications this week, semi-finals, quarterfinals. I'm not positive
[01:42.080 --> 01:49.120]  how are you in the great city of New York this morning? Well, I am feeling incredibly festive. I
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.400]  mean everywhere you walk in this city, it's beautifully decorated. It's absolutely packed.
[01:55.040 --> 02:00.880]  Your standard 15 minute drive right now takes about an hour and a half. That's to go about eight
[02:00.880 --> 02:08.400]  blocks. So it's packed. There's shoppers everywhere. No regard for cars, a lot of bikes. Really it's
[01:42.560 --> 01:48.160]  fine. You? Yeah, fine. Your hair's looking good today. Hey, thanks. Yours too, brother. Yeah,
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.160]  boy, we got some hair going on. How do you like us now? To my right, Douglas, Alvin, Vaughn,
[01:52.160 --> 01:58.000]  bringing the heat as always across from me. Fingers, plowhawk. To my left, the great Ken,
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.600]  Iggy, Strode, and then in my booth in my stead as I sit here because Tim is on vacation.
[02:03.600 --> 02:10.000]  KG in out town is kind enough to come help us out today. Welcome everybody for the final show of
[02:08.400 --> 02:14.320]  packed, but it's kind of fun. I'm happy to be here. We got a nice weekend of football and I had
[02:14.320 --> 02:20.000]  the choice last night in a championship round to play Derek Carr or Tommy Cutlets and guess what I
[02:20.000 --> 02:31.280]  did? I played Derek Carr. 30 some points. Bang. Over the hometown guy, the talk of the town up there
[02:31.280 --> 02:37.040]  in New York, Tommy Cutlets. I just couldn't risk the biscuit even though so many times this season,
[01:46.720 --> 01:52.720]  because my team stink this year. But you can send your... Not to mention some great tips for some
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.880]  holiday loving, all available with you if you text in your two-part question.
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.440]  Lisa Ann. So this is the morning after presented to you by Brown and Crouppen. Apologies there.
[02:01.440 --> 02:06.160]  But I've mentioned the EDF group text inbox. They are the text inbox sponsor and they are
[02:06.160 --> 02:11.600]  wonderful sponsor. Pause and can I hear about the EDF group? Yes, please. Well, the EDF group is the
[02:11.600 --> 02:21.280]  title sponsor of our text inbox on TMA 314-881-TMA5. That's engineer design facilities, but now known
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.560]  as the EDF group, the sponsor of the TMA text inbox. And the name of the game on this show is
[02:26.560 --> 02:32.000]  supporting the sponsors. And if you want to support the EDF group as sponsor of TMA text inbox,
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.880]  well, it's real simple. Do you have a fire extinguisher where you work? The answer is yes,
[02:37.040 --> 02:43.440]  Derek Carr has failed to reach my approval. It was a desperation play and I did it. That's a big
[02:43.440 --> 02:48.320]  move. This is the time of year where decisions like that can be make or break. You know,
[02:48.320 --> 02:54.240]  those are big money swings on those decisions like that. Thank you. Appreciate it. It was a tough one
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.480]  to make. Yeah, we got it. Who's been the biggest surprise this year among all the fancy players,
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.760]  would you say? I'm going to say, keep it in last night's game. Kyron Williams putting up another
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.880]  2023. Oh, this is it. Yeah, it's kind of like a, it's like if you miss the year end awards,
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.440]  this will be the gala, you know, virtually. You can't come in here. I noticed you guys were dressed
[02:19.440 --> 02:22.640]  up really nice today. Yeah, black tie today, black tie today, but that's just, it's a white
[02:22.640 --> 02:27.120]  black tie. It's like James Bond. It's effortless. So when we leave the air today, we'll have to say
[02:27.120 --> 02:30.800]  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. That's right. Yeah, that's right. Seasons greetings.
[02:30.800 --> 02:35.280]  Oh, we can do that. Yeah. Merry Christmas to everybody out there. Some call it
[02:36.880 --> 02:45.840]  you certainly do. So please email the EDF group at fire at the EDF group.com so a technician can
[02:45.840 --> 02:52.320]  come out and explain to your team how the EDF group can save your company money. Again, that
[02:52.320 --> 02:58.640]  email address is fire at the EDF group.com. The EDF group is hot and will prevent your facility
[02:58.640 --> 03:05.760]  from having hot fires. Experience the EDF group difference. Learn more at the EDF group.com
[03:03.760 --> 03:08.880]  104 yards last night. I drafted him in the last round in three leagues just because the last round
[03:08.880 --> 03:14.480]  I'd like to take a player that I'm intrigued by that I think could have some sneaky potential.
[03:14.480 --> 03:18.880]  I didn't really feel great about can makers in Los Angeles because if you remember last year,
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.520]  can makers did want to leave LA and then it kind of got moved over. We know how those things
[03:23.520 --> 03:27.760]  usually go. It's the couple that breaks up and gets back together all the time. Eventually it ends.
[03:27.760 --> 03:32.240]  So that was where Kyron Williams was able to come right in, step right up. He proved himself
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.560]  prominent winter holiday. I call it Christmas. Yeah. I guess we can call it Christmas.
[02:40.560 --> 02:43.920]  You celebrate Christmas in a big way, do you? I celebrate it. Yeah, sure.
[02:44.800 --> 02:48.160]  Well, whatever you celebrate. You have a tree and everything growing up? Yeah. Okay. Whatever
[02:48.160 --> 02:53.440]  you celebrate, that's what you say. I celebrate Christmas. No. No, if I know, if I know one of my
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.520]  friends is Jewish, I'll say Happy Hanukkah. Sure. Yeah. But Hanukkah is over, isn't it?
[02:57.520 --> 03:00.560]  Hanukkah is over, yeah. Yeah. So you don't have to worry about that anymore. Did you get a bunch
[03:05.920 --> 03:12.640]  or you can email them at the EDF group at fire at the EDF group.com. And Doug, look at our hair.
[03:12.640 --> 03:16.960]  Look at our hair, baby. Yeah, would you just like, it's almost not fair anymore. For real. Because we
[03:16.960 --> 03:23.040]  were already impossibly handsome. Dashing even. And now for me to get the front half of my hair back,
[03:23.920 --> 03:28.080]  I don't know what to tell everybody else. Yeah. You're just going to have to deal with it, I guess.
[03:28.080 --> 03:33.680]  When you walk in, when you walk into a building, everyone knows sex is in town. Well, that's the
[03:32.240 --> 03:36.640]  before they even made the can makers decision. So for me, it's been Kyron Williams looking
[03:36.640 --> 03:43.920]  forward to him running all over the New York Giants in their matchup over nears. Kyron Williams,
[03:43.920 --> 03:50.080]  St. Louis, Leisa Ann, Vianney High School. St. Louis and a lot of St. Louis talent actually.
[03:50.080 --> 03:54.560]  Most of the top players in the NFL are from St. Louis. That's right. That's right. Jameson
[03:54.560 --> 03:59.200]  Williams. Top radio host star by the way. Yeah, sure. Bingo. You nailed it. What was that saying?
[03:00.560 --> 03:06.080]  of presents for that? Not really. When I was a kid, yeah. But like I said, only my mom and I are
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.840]  Jewish. So for the rest of my family, we do Christmas and stuff. And so, yeah, I don't get
[03:11.840 --> 03:17.520]  every present ever on Hanukkah, like one or two. And that's fine. And then you got more presents
[03:17.520 --> 03:23.200]  for Christmas. Sure. You were kind of double dipping. Yes and no. I don't think I got any
[03:23.200 --> 03:27.840]  more presents than anyone else. No. That is fine. It's less Hanukkah to me is less about the presents
[03:33.680 --> 03:39.200]  rumblings that I hear. Yeah. Sure. Now I didn't have the front half of my hair for about 15, 20
[03:39.200 --> 03:44.560]  years or so, but it's back, baby. Toughs. Toughs of wispy toughness. Yep. Yep. And I got it from
[03:44.560 --> 03:50.080]  stainless hair restoration. Yeah, absolutely. Dr. Polinga and Greg Cryling there run that operation,
[03:50.080 --> 03:54.080]  both products or patients are their own product, which will tell you something, you know, they
[03:54.080 --> 03:57.040]  wouldn't do it themselves if they didn't think it worked. And they don't just think it worked. It
[03:57.040 --> 04:01.600]  does work. Look at us. Look at me on YouTube. Yeah. I don't have a hairline like this, do you? No,
[03:59.280 --> 04:03.040]  Leisa Ann, when you look at the AFC here, this is so curious to me because it's like
[04:03.760 --> 04:07.680]  I get the Ravens are have the best record, but like, do you think that they are legitimately
[04:07.680 --> 04:12.480]  the best team? And furthermore, like who's getting in the playoffs? A lot of these eight
[04:12.480 --> 04:15.040]  and six teams. There's eight and six teams just everywhere.
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.600]  You're right about the Ravens. I mean, the consistency of the play, what Levar Jackson
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.680]  is doing. We're looking at all of these other teams like these next two weeks, they're going
[03:27.840 --> 03:33.040]  more about just like being together with the family and then latkes, potato pancakes. That's
[03:33.040 --> 03:38.000]  what it's about. I love potato pancakes. Latkes. Latkes. Potato pancakes. They're
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.120]  absolute. It's like a hash brown patty. Really? Just outstanding. It is? Oh, it's so good.
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.960]  I make them all the time. I actually use in Shnooks. They have the Jewish company that makes it.
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.360]  Well, that would make sense. TJC. I mean, you can buy it. TJC. You can buy it. The Jewish company,
[03:55.360 --> 04:01.440]  that's the name of it? That's a hell of an LLC right there. No, try to pronounce it. Let's see how this goes.
[04:03.840 --> 04:10.800]  Halashkin. I don't know. You're looking at me. I don't know. I don't know. Do you know what
[04:10.800 --> 04:18.080]  the company is? They make boxed, it's only one at Shnooks. It's boxed potato pancakes.
[04:18.080 --> 04:22.320]  I honestly don't know. You just mix it up with some water. We always get all of our food from
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.680]  unless you're 18 years old, you don't. Damn right. And they say, I'm not done yet growing all these
[04:05.680 --> 04:09.440]  wispy toughness. Still coming. I'd love to hear. I can't wait to see the progress. They say,
[04:09.440 --> 04:13.040]  you don't see the finished product for about a year. Yep. When you have the FUE procedure,
[04:13.040 --> 04:18.640]  like I had. Yep. And I sat there and relaxed for about four hours, watched TV, had a little
[04:18.640 --> 04:24.160]  chick-fil-a for lunch, and they did all the work. And I just reap the benefits later. Absolutely.
[04:24.160 --> 04:26.400]  It's a normal day for me. I could just go in there and knock it out.
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.520]  to matter more than we could have ever thought because the Kansas City Chiefs either have to
[04:29.520 --> 04:35.040]  get it together or give it up. That's going to be really interesting to see Broncos are back all
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.440]  over the charts without PJ Stroud. I think that's the Texans have a little bit of a struggle, but
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.160]  who thought we'd be here and have so many question marks? And I don't think we'd have this many
[04:44.160 --> 04:48.640]  doubts if there wasn't so much quarterback transition. And then when there's good quarterback
[04:48.640 --> 04:54.320]  play, like when it comes to Kansas City with Patrick Holmes, there's not enough. So, you know,
[04:22.320 --> 04:30.720]  the Presbyterian company. Anybody out there knows that company. It's, I don't know. But anyway,
[04:30.720 --> 04:37.920]  I know it's good. It's a company that specializes in potato pancakes. I get them every once in a while.
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.520]  Especially when I have pork chops. I have pork chops, potato pancakes, and applesauce. Do you throw
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.600]  applesauce on there? I'm a sour cream guy personally, but to each their own does something. Is it
[04:26.400 --> 04:28.720]  Well, have you considered it?
[04:30.320 --> 04:35.680]  Um, okay. I'm okay with my hair. All right. My hair feels great. If you're not, that's where to go.
[04:35.680 --> 04:39.760]  Yeah. Same with hair restoration. I didn't like the look of my hairline, the crown of my head.
[04:39.760 --> 04:45.040]  It wasn't doing great. When you got a consultation for Same with Hair Restoration. My process wasn't
[04:45.040 --> 04:50.880]  as invasive as Doug's, even though his was very low pain, obviously. There was no pain. No pain at
[04:54.320 --> 04:58.560]  you've got teams that have so many receivers, but nobody to throw the ball at them. And then the
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.360]  riches and the pours on the other side. Do you think the Chiefs are going to get right? I know
[05:03.360 --> 05:09.520]  some people around this area who have become Chiefs fans are concerned about the viability
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.040]  of them in the playoffs. If they do, in fact, make the play, do you think that they will get right?
[05:13.040 --> 05:18.400]  Or did they just lack talent, especially in the skill positions to get there? Yeah, I think that's
[05:18.400 --> 05:24.000]  a tough one. I think they do lack talent that Patrick Holmes can trust. I think being, you know,
[04:45.680 --> 04:51.200]  mannishwhites? That's it. I thought it was mannishhevits? Mannishwhites, yeah. That's it.
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.000]  They used to advertise for wine. Mannishhevits wine. It is wine. Mannishhevits is wine. Mannishvits wine is for two.
[04:58.800 --> 05:02.880]  Very sweet grape. Yeah, we used to, we're not even Jewish, and that's for some reason that's what we had
[05:03.680 --> 05:07.520]  for Thanksgiving. My dad would open a bottle of mannishhevits. You'd have mannishhevits? Yeah,
[05:07.520 --> 05:12.080]  I don't know why. Hey, some people like things. And some people don't like other things. The only
[04:50.880 --> 04:56.160]  all. It's super easy. Mine is just simply Finasteride, which is the generic form of Propecia
[04:56.160 --> 05:00.400]  that I take every morning and I wear this little laser cap at night. It helps get the blood flowing.
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.080]  It helps with that. Probably like six minutes though, right? Oh, it's yeah. Super, super easy.
[05:04.080 --> 05:07.200]  You don't have to wear it for long at all. You even forget it's on after that six minutes,
[05:07.200 --> 05:11.760]  but you take it off. Easy money. And we're seeing some serious results, as you can see on YouTube.
[05:11.760 --> 05:16.560]  The hair's feeling good, man. I really like where I'm at. Does an alarm go off after six minutes?
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.240]  knowing that Travis Kelsey is going to be double covered. I mean, that's common sense for every team
[05:28.240 --> 05:32.480]  scheme. Am I, who else are you going to rely on? That's really tricky using the run game with a
[05:32.480 --> 05:37.120]  layer is, you know, we see it works when they let it happen. Why they don't let it happen more?
[05:37.120 --> 05:43.360]  We'll see. But Vegas is playing with a whole new momentum after the, you know, change of guards
[05:43.360 --> 05:48.480]  in Las Vegas again. So we're seeing that transition. Isn't it tough matchup, even though it's at home,
[05:12.080 --> 05:16.560]  time I got to drink wine when I was a kid was at Thanksgiving. That's a lot of sugar, mannishhevits,
[05:16.560 --> 05:21.280]  so I think you'd be all right. We may have a guest later on. I saw Nikki Glaser coming in.
[05:21.280 --> 05:25.600]  I actually let her in the building. I said, hey, when you leave the court and he showed us,
[05:25.600 --> 05:31.840]  pop in and say hi. Oh, Nikki Glaser. Okay. She's shaping, taping her HBO special, another HBO
[05:31.840 --> 05:37.280]  special coming out. Really? Yeah, so that coming up from her motive. Is she still doing the F-Boy
[05:48.480 --> 05:54.000]  I think that's going to help a lot, but it's tough for Mahomes. It's got a tough spot to be. We've
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.280]  seen them switch out gadget players before they were fine without Tyree Gill. But now it's really
[05:59.280 --> 06:04.640]  come and claim. As we said earlier, most of the top players are from this area or at least Missouri,
[06:04.640 --> 06:11.280]  including Drew Locke. Yeah. But what do you think of his play this year and his future moving forward?
[06:12.720 --> 06:18.000]  True love. So he's going to be a backup. I mean, I kind of see that's how the NFL sees him. He comes
[05:16.640 --> 05:21.120]  I use buzzes. Yeah, you're good. What if you kept it on there for like hours? It'd be fun.
[05:21.120 --> 05:25.680]  It would be? Yeah, it'd be fun. Super, yeah, it's not dangerous or anything. Super, super easy. And
[05:25.680 --> 05:30.160]  it was very kind. Them to help us out and they can help you out as well because that's what they do.
[05:30.160 --> 05:34.320]  They help people. You might think, ah, it's like super, it's not what it is. It really helps people.
[05:35.200 --> 05:38.720]  Yeah, don't spend the next 15 or 20 years of your life looking in the mirror saying,
[05:38.720 --> 05:42.880]  this is not the way I want to look. Do something about it. We got a great resource right here in
[05:37.280 --> 05:41.760]  Island? I talked to her about that. I said, I got to watch that. She goes, it's only on CW,
[05:41.760 --> 05:46.800]  now the app. I said, I watched it last year on Hulu. I thought it was on HBO. Or HBO. She goes,
[05:46.800 --> 05:52.800]  now it's only on CW. Her and Liv Golf. They won't watch it just because it's on the CW?
[05:53.760 --> 05:57.760]  Well, they can't have any nudity or cussing in it. And you won't watch anything that doesn't have
[05:57.760 --> 06:01.680]  either? That means Ken is out. Can you assist on cussing? If Nikki Glaser isn't cussing,
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.760]  in, he can do it. And he's a good backup with that. And what's wrong with not going up there and
[06:21.760 --> 06:26.720]  getting hit every week? I don't really see him exceeding a spot and take over a full-time role.
[06:26.720 --> 06:31.520]  Do you Doug? Well, I hope so. Just because I like him and he was so good at Missouri, I thought he
[06:31.520 --> 06:36.560]  was going to be a solid NFL quarterback, but he sure didn't do much when he got his chance first
[06:36.560 --> 06:41.680]  couple of years in the league. Yeah. And I think we don't have second chances. Now it's interesting
[06:41.680 --> 06:47.680]  to see players like Gardner Minshew and Baker Mayfield out there as design starters and succeeding
[05:42.880 --> 05:47.360]  St. Louis at St. Louis Hair Restoration, their website, of course, stloesshairrestoration.com.
[05:48.480 --> 05:52.720]  All right, you were on stage two the morning after, presented by Brian Krupa in the eight o'clock hour.
[05:52.720 --> 05:55.920]  I feel like Iggy has some take. He's been ruffling with that box for a little bit. You've done a lot
[05:55.920 --> 05:59.280]  of work over there. What in the world are you doing over there? I was looking at the gift we
[05:59.280 --> 06:04.880]  got from Robert. But we hear you rough opening boxes and... You couldn't hear that. We absolutely
[06:04.880 --> 06:08.560]  could. It sounded like a chipmunk. Can you hear this if I do this?
[06:01.680 --> 06:08.160]  it's not really Nikki Glaser. She works blue, Doug. But she can be funny. We're not watching blue.
[06:08.160 --> 06:14.560]  Well, she can, but I don't know the whole point of F-Boy Island. There's got to be some sex and
[06:14.560 --> 06:20.400]  some cussing in there. Or else it's just a survivor. And you can't enjoy it without the
[06:20.400 --> 06:25.200]  without the cussing. I don't think, Blacklist is the last thing I watched on regular TV.
[06:26.400 --> 06:31.280]  Because you insist on cussing. No, there's no cussing in Blacklist. It was on NBC.
[06:09.120 --> 06:15.600]  Can you hear that? You were ripping off the thing that you could just pull off.
[06:16.400 --> 06:21.120]  Well, I didn't want to throw it in there. You know, when you get things that big, you want to kind of
[06:21.120 --> 06:24.800]  fold them up a little bit so they fit in the trash can. Well, you gotta wait till the commercial
[06:24.800 --> 06:31.360]  breakfast roll thing's in the trash can anyway. Oh, that got him crestfalled. Sorry. Right here
[06:31.360 --> 06:34.320]  at the holidays. Right here at the holidays I got him crestfalled. The Christmas season, Doug. Take it
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.960]  when we thought they fell off the cliff too. So it does kind of prove to you that at any time that
[06:52.960 --> 06:57.920]  could change, right? Drew Locke could be the next Gardner Minshew or Baker Mayfield. Yeah, Seattle's
[06:57.920 --> 07:02.160]  kind of a prime example of that with Geno Smith getting his second chance and really taking
[07:02.160 --> 07:07.600]  advantage of that. We say, and how you feel about Christmas, NFL, they had three games,
[07:07.600 --> 07:12.400]  including Ravens and Niners, top two teams in the league there. Whether you're going to settle in
[07:12.400 --> 07:16.720]  on Christmas day and just watch football day. I mean, I think it's a bit much. I mean, that was
[06:31.840 --> 06:36.800]  Now I'd watch it on Netflix once it was over on NBC. Then I'd watch the season on Netflix.
[06:38.400 --> 06:42.560]  Haven't really watched the network program in a long time. Well, it's a shame it's come to that.
[06:42.560 --> 06:48.160]  You think there's got to be cursing for it to be good entertainment. Well, it's got some nudity in it, too.
[06:48.160 --> 06:54.160]  Well, that's a key point there, Doug. You can get involved. Send in if you like nudity and cussing.
[06:54.160 --> 06:59.040]  And your favorite toppings for potato pancakes. That's all available on the EDF Group Text Inbox,
[06:34.320 --> 06:39.600]  from the listeners. I take it from you. Doesn't matter. Well, just don't pitch things into the
[06:39.600 --> 06:44.640]  trash can while people are talking. It was a piece of paper. Okay. Oh, no, I'm crestfalled.
[06:46.560 --> 06:51.280]  All right, eggs. Bring the heat. This is your time, baby. Okay. Now, there's a few in this
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.360]  2024 Missouri Sports Hall of Fame that I guess are deserving.
[06:57.200 --> 07:02.240]  Jackson probably has heard of this guy, Anthony Tolliver. Yep. Kickapoo High School and played
[07:16.720 --> 07:21.920]  always an NBA day for me. My friends, I love to go to the Christmas day game. I'm actually going to
[07:21.920 --> 07:29.360]  WWE at MSG the day after Christmas. Oh, for heaven's sakes. At MSG. Yes. So I'm going to get into
[07:29.360 --> 07:35.280]  some wrestling before the year ends for me. But yeah, it's a lot. People have things to do on
[07:35.280 --> 07:39.360]  Christmas. Like I'll be watching just because I love watching games. It'll give me another reason.
[07:39.360 --> 07:45.520]  It's still, but yeah, it's a lot. Yeah, definitely. I just like that. I think it's perfect that that
[06:59.040 --> 07:04.320]  where you can get involved in this particular radio presentation. The final TMA presented to
[07:04.320 --> 07:13.280]  you by Brian Crouppen of the year 2023. Text on N314881TMA5. That's the EDF Group Text Inbox.
[07:13.280 --> 07:20.640]  You can also call and talk to KG in O-Town. That number is 636-904-TMA. We're looking for
[07:20.640 --> 07:24.960]  a couple phone calls today. You know, why not? Talk it over with us. Have a little press conference
[07:02.240 --> 07:08.160]  in the NBA. Great player. Justin Britt played in the NFL at 11 on high school. And Lucas
[07:08.160 --> 07:12.800]  Harrell. I'm not familiar with Lucas Harrell. Ozark High School and Major League Baseball.
[07:14.480 --> 07:20.160]  Not sure where he played baseball, but anyway. Look at the major leagues. He must have been
[07:20.160 --> 07:27.120]  pretty good. Now we get down to the ones that will fill tables. Oh, brother. Bob Balate,
[07:27.120 --> 07:32.080]  Director of Springfield Green County Park Board. He did great work for that park board. Huge,
[07:45.520 --> 07:49.760]  Monday night game, that Christmas night game is Ravens and Niners. I mean, you can't, that's,
[07:49.760 --> 07:53.040]  yeah, that's the one we're going to watch. Yeah, that's game of the year right there. Send in your
[07:53.040 --> 07:56.960]  two-part questions. We have Lisa Ann on the phone lines with us. Fancy football,
[07:56.960 --> 08:01.440]  Friday's two-part questions are always welcome and we'll kick it off with the Hall of Famer himself.
[08:01.440 --> 08:07.200]  Carlos Spicier, we, he asked first part, Lisa Ann, since my fancy season ended because Travis Kelsey
[08:07.200 --> 08:11.280]  decides to stop catching the football in lieu of Taylor Swift next year. Should I try to draft
[07:33.040 --> 07:37.440]  I won't sit here and listen to you downgrade the work he did on some of the grass and nothing
[07:37.440 --> 07:41.840]  against these people and their families. Congratulations to us. Not I'm just saying
[07:41.840 --> 07:47.760]  it is called a hall of fame. You're raining on their Hall of Fame. Steve Boyce High School
[07:47.760 --> 07:57.040]  Swim Coach. Lindsay Hunter James University of Missouri Volleyball player 2003 to 2006 Kickapoo
[07:24.960 --> 07:30.160]  Friday to end the year 2023. You can also send in an email for a chance to win the Design Air
[07:30.160 --> 07:35.200]  Heating and Cooling email today. You can send those in the morning after at insidestl.com.
[07:35.200 --> 07:41.040]  Buck Swope has taken the month of December, which works well because he was the emailer of the year
[07:41.040 --> 07:47.280]  at the year-end awards. JV Golf Coach with three wins. The Gunter Agency has two. And then Brian
[07:47.280 --> 07:51.120]  Henschen, who's a bowl executive, the Calcified Air Chairman, Steve and Kevin Miller, all the
[08:11.280 --> 08:15.680]  players with uglier wives or girlfriends relatively speaking? And then question two,
[08:15.680 --> 08:20.000]  did you hear that Doug is officially a gilf? I think he should make a white push to join the
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.800]  industry. That's Carlos Spicier, yes, Lisa Ann. Doug Vaughn is now a grandfather. His son,
[08:24.800 --> 08:28.960]  John and his lovely wife, Jill, have had a baby. So Doug is now a grandfather.
[08:30.880 --> 08:37.280]  Doug, congratulations on earning the badge of guilt status. I mean, that is earned. That is
[07:57.040 --> 08:03.040]  High School Boys Basketball era. Good era. Now a guy I guess he's deserving. He was my boss in
[08:03.040 --> 08:12.800]  Springfield at Jock. So he would be deserving. Tom Ladd. But he's known for being the Missouri
[08:12.800 --> 08:21.200]  State Lady Bears play by play guy. Okay. About 20 years. I've been doing this for 32 years.
[08:21.200 --> 08:26.720]  But not doing play by play, but big sport. You're sitting here talking nonsense. And ruffling paper.
[07:51.120 --> 07:56.960]  one apiece. You can get involved and join the likes of those. I guess they're all gentlemen.
[07:56.960 --> 08:01.520]  I can't be sure. No, they all got baseball tickets, most of them, didn't they? Good amount of them.
[08:01.520 --> 08:07.440]  Yeah, Buck Swope, JV Golf Coach, Gunter, I believe Chairman Steve got some. Kevin Miller won that
[08:07.440 --> 08:12.160]  day after we stopped giving the tickets. Bad beat for the bad beat for the young man coming up on
[08:12.160 --> 08:16.160]  the captain's log. We'll have the Design Air Heating and Cooling email today. Lisa Ann will also be
[08:37.280 --> 08:42.640]  not given. Yeah. The poster boy have a gilf now, Doug. Yeah, I understand. You know,
[08:42.640 --> 08:47.600]  stalkers, ugh. It's a burden. It's a burden because, you know, I wind up having to tell
[08:47.600 --> 08:51.280]  so many people no. Right. Thank you. Right. And I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. That's
[08:51.280 --> 08:54.320]  the big thing with me. I don't want, just don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. Especially that
[08:54.320 --> 08:59.760]  new hair. Yeah, this new hair. If you remember, Mike Lee proposed to me, like I go through this
[08:59.760 --> 09:04.160]  every day, you know, I understand, but guilt status, you know, you've got to understand the
[08:27.920 --> 08:33.280]  I mean, I basically put Jock on the map for heaven's sake. We all need that. You think what
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.760]  we do here is important that it would be worthy of Hall of Fame consideration? This is the
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.640]  nonsense that we're talking about. What you do, yes. I'll give you an example and nothing against
[08:42.640 --> 08:45.920]  this lady because I love her to death and she's well deserving. But you know, Clabe's going to
[08:45.920 --> 08:51.680]  the Missouri Broadcasting Hall of Fame. I think the ceremony is in the Ozarks, which I won't be
[08:16.160 --> 08:22.000]  joining us for her the last time of 2023 because we are off next week. She'll be joining via the
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.880]  phone line today. She can't join via the arrow link, but we're looking forward to having Lisa Ann
[08:26.880 --> 08:32.720]  on the presentation today. Get involved. Let's talk it over. Applesauce is the correct answer
[08:32.720 --> 08:37.360]  for potato pancakes topping. Only the Ultra Fat staffs them in sour cream. That's from Carlos
[08:37.360 --> 08:40.880]  Spicy-Ween. Oh, no, I've had sour cream on them. That's what I use. They're good, too.
[08:51.680 --> 08:58.960]  going to. But also going with him is Wendy Weese. She's been on radio and TV for about 30 plus years.
[08:58.960 --> 09:05.280]  How long have you been on radio and TV? Well, 40. Just being on a long time just means you're old.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.760]  That's all. Just means you showed up for work and you got old. It's a war of attrition.
[09:09.760 --> 09:13.680]  I'm comparing you and Wendy Weese. You pretty much did the same thing except you did more TV than
[09:13.680 --> 09:17.680]  she did. I just don't think years alone get you there. You have to have accomplished something.
[09:04.160 --> 09:08.880]  heat's going to be back on you. It's like a really young girl, young, younger woman, you know,
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.120]  18, 19 years old with beautiful blue eyes, you know, she's going to get all the attention.
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.680]  Right now, you're going to get all the attention because you, my friend, are a guilt. Yeah. Yeah.
[09:17.680 --> 09:23.280]  Well, it's hard to argue that point. But thank you anyway. Yeah, I didn't, before I didn't think I
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.400]  was old enough to be a grandfather, but clearly I am, I guess. I don't know how that happens.
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.800]  A little sex appeal that goes with that. So, you know, you enjoy it there, Doug. Oh, you think?
[08:40.880 --> 08:48.480]  Just a light, just a light smear. Do you consider yourself an ultra fat? No, no, no. I might have
[08:48.480 --> 08:53.280]  asked me a year ago, buh, a year ago. Do you think you have the sort of frame that might support 400
[08:53.280 --> 08:58.160]  pounds someday? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because like my arms are skinny, I'd look pretty weird. Well,
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.560]  they wouldn't be. I guess, yeah, I'd have that like little underarm flap. Like the Michelin Man. Yeah,
[09:02.560 --> 09:07.600]  you know that little flap on the underarm. Sure. Isn't that hot? Like wings. Very hot. No, I do when
[09:17.680 --> 09:23.840]  So have you. What? What have you accomplished compared to Wendy Weese? I haven't figured it out.
[09:23.840 --> 09:28.640]  Well, what have I done? Not much except show up. That was my game plan all along. You should be in
[09:28.640 --> 09:34.880]  the same game. Show up. Don't steal anything. You should be in the broadcasting hall of fame.
[09:34.880 --> 09:40.240]  I haven't done anything. It's different for play by play guys because they're very much a part of
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.800]  the team. We're all familiar with Jennifer Drumma Claffin, Smith Cotton High School
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.440]  You know, the uglier girlfriend. I don't know about you guys, but you can look at all these
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.760]  guys' girlfriends. They're all very beautiful. I mean, I don't see many NFL players with
[09:41.760 --> 09:46.080]  girlfriends that aren't beautiful. I mean, Taylor's definitely the top of the heap, right? But,
[09:46.880 --> 09:50.640]  you're not going to be able to judge that way. I don't think it's, I don't think it's Taylor's fault
[09:50.640 --> 09:56.640]  at all. The Travis is getting double covered. And I also think he is getting older as a tight end
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.480]  and doesn't need to have that much response going out of the field. They need more depth when it
[09:07.680 --> 09:12.480]  I have like, I've had a steak before and potato pancakes. Then I will put sour cream on the
[09:13.200 --> 09:20.880]  potato pancake. The applesauce is more for the pork chop. There you go. I'm more of a pierogi
[09:20.880 --> 09:25.120]  kind of gal over a latke. Is that offensive? That's from Mrs. Janie Shanahan. Do you like what you like?
[09:25.920 --> 09:29.840]  Well, not even close. One is fried. The other one's kind of boiled, isn't it? I don't know. I don't
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.560]  know if I've ever had a pierogi to be honest with you. Boiled food. Boiled food. That's a throwback
[09:47.440 --> 09:50.640]  and University of Central Missouri track and field. That's Sedalia there.
[09:50.640 --> 09:56.720]  Smith Cotton. Jim Rayner. He's in sports medicine. Scott Stifferman. He's in cycling. Oh, scoots.
[09:57.520 --> 10:01.120]  Scooter. Tammy Williams. He would get mad. They'd call him war scoots.
[10:01.120 --> 10:05.440]  Tammy Williams. Osceola High School Northwestern University and U.S. Olympic
[10:05.440 --> 10:12.880]  softball player. Oh yeah. T-Dub. Now this is really getting into an era here. 1988 to 1995
[09:34.560 --> 09:39.600]  to early 2023 when we were in Jamaica. We were in Jamaica at the buffet line and it had all the
[09:39.600 --> 09:45.360]  food labeled. Here's scrambled eggs. Here's sausage. Here's boiled food. And we couldn't even
[09:45.360 --> 09:50.960]  identify what it was. Yeah, this is, I missed that time because like we had the passport situation.
[09:51.600 --> 09:57.440]  I was nervous about getting mine as well. Oh, I remember that. God, great content with that. Like
[10:00.480 --> 10:04.960]  comes to wide receivers and some slot receivers as well. Have you ever seen a girlfriend that was
[10:04.960 --> 10:12.080]  butt ugly? I mean, uglier than a mud fence. I mean, we all see the internet, yes.
[10:12.720 --> 10:17.760]  Doug's so folksy. They're out there. So folksy, Doug. Uglier than most. I'm not sure I've ever seen one.
[10:18.960 --> 10:24.080]  There's probably somebody struck out, but you don't see it a lot. CMC,
[10:24.080 --> 10:28.000]  Christian McCaffrey's wife, is that Sophia Culpo? Am I pronouncing that last name right?
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.160]  Warsaw High School football era. Oh, they're big old bruisers. Yeah, boy, they had some teams in.
[10:19.840 --> 10:23.440]  Paula Wannhaus Weidman, Missouri State West Plains Volleyball.
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.080]  Good setter. The John Q. Hammond's founder award is going to Wendy's of Missouri. Love myself a
[10:30.080 --> 10:35.280]  bacon. Well, they've been a big supporter, big sponsor of sports. I guess so. Dave Kuchey, he's
[10:35.280 --> 10:41.440]  getting the President's Award. Oh, Kuche. And this is one that is very deserving. Art Haynes is getting
[09:58.320 --> 10:04.800]  weeks leading up to the Jamaica trip. Yeah, that was a fun trip. Oh, Madison still talks about it.
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.640]  She loves it. I mean, it's just getting away. Yeah, the key of it was that it was so cold here
[10:10.640 --> 10:17.600]  and then we got to go to Jamaica and it was lovely out. Yeah, it sounded fun. Great. Remember how cold
[10:17.600 --> 10:21.840]  it was last year at this time? Are they froze all the airports? Oh my god, last year this time
[10:21.840 --> 10:26.080]  bragging rights came, it was like minus 40 with the wind show. Right. And now a year later, we're
[10:28.400 --> 10:37.120]  She's unbelievable. She's unbelievable. So beautiful. So they're a beautiful couple. I would like them
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.840]  to procreate for sure. Yeah. Have you seen Christian McCaffrey's jawline, Doug? No, no,
[10:41.840 --> 10:46.080]  I haven't paid attention to that. Unbelievable. I have so much jealousy for that. No, no needs for
[10:46.080 --> 10:52.640]  a strategic beer. Do you ever have a date with an NFL player? Doug, why are we going down this road?
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.880]  I don't know. If I could be so bold, I just thought that was the next thing that popped into my head.
[10:41.440 --> 10:48.560]  the Inspiration Award, which he got. He battled, I think he had like West Nile flu. Something weird.
[10:48.560 --> 10:52.000]  Yeah, he was in the hospital. I knew him briefly way back in college. Yeah, he was in the hospital
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.920]  for a long time, but he's... Steve Savard had to take his place on the Missouri Bears football
[10:55.920 --> 11:00.480]  game. Yeah, but Art Haynes is getting the Inspiration Award. Very, very good award. Very well deserving.
[11:02.560 --> 11:05.440]  I don't know what these other ones are. These are the Win Award.
[10:26.160 --> 10:32.320]  talking about this global war. I said yesterday, Christmas is going to be a 90 plus degree
[10:32.320 --> 10:37.600]  difference than last Christmas with the wind chill. Did you see, you know, American Airlines had all
[10:37.600 --> 10:42.800]  those problems last year. They got fined $140 million for the problems that they had.
[10:43.920 --> 10:49.760]  Does that seem fair? $140 million. The government hit them with a fine. Lambert? No,
[10:50.400 --> 10:55.600]  Southwest Airlines. Oh really? Yeah. Well, I mean, doesn't every business have a problem at times?
[10:56.960 --> 11:00.160]  I bet you've known a few players. He's using that grandpa equity. Yeah.
[11:01.040 --> 11:05.600]  I'm using that grandpa. I'm going to plead the fifth on this and focus on your listeners.
[11:05.600 --> 11:09.760]  It's championship week. All right. You're right. It's all right to get something.
[11:09.760 --> 11:16.480]  Okay. Well, Lisa, should I start Mark Bulger over Lamar Jackson? Also, my brother recently started
[11:16.480 --> 11:20.480]  dating a woman and my jealousy is boiling. I mean, I should be the one dating him, not her.
[11:20.480 --> 11:24.640]  I mean, that chiseled jaw. Come on already. This is nonsense. It's from the Dogtown Astro Van.
[11:05.600 --> 11:13.520]  Sherry Gentry Gula, Camden High School. Well, they don't make any claims to be
[11:13.520 --> 11:19.920]  Cooperstown or Canton. This is a Hall of Fame for all of Missouri, the high schools, small
[11:19.920 --> 11:22.720]  college, large college. I don't think you're calling it a Hall of Fame. It's kind of...
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.560]  Well, what else would you call it if you recognize some people from all over the state?
[11:27.440 --> 11:30.000]  I have lithographs at home for when I lived down there.
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.080]  Do they all get fined like that? Yeah, we also got to think about the inconvenience for the
[11:00.080 --> 11:05.120]  passengers. I think you have to reimburse them in some form or fashion. So we can give them their
[11:05.120 --> 11:10.160]  money back for the ticket. Maybe that just lost cost. That's what I mean. I know, but is this
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.880]  embedded into their lost cost? Is it because it's regulated by the FAA that they have the right to
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.440]  do that? That was my first thought was that there was some FAA thing along the lines of some sort of
[11:30.800 --> 11:33.760]  Of the years that I was down there, they had the induction
[11:34.800 --> 11:37.600]  and they had the lithographs of the people and they were signed by these people.
[11:38.240 --> 11:42.000]  I mean, I'm talking one lithograph has Ozzy Smith, Dan Quisenberry,
[11:42.960 --> 11:50.400]  Bo Burton. There were no high school errors or no... One of them has a fisherman on it.
[11:50.400 --> 11:54.960]  That's a joke. I mean, if you're catching bluegill for a living, you should go into Hall of Fame.
[11:25.040 --> 11:30.000]  Yeah. Have you expressed yourself to your brother that this is a point of contention? You know that
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.920]  you're playing Lamar Jackson and you're trolling me. Yeah. Communication is key in situations like
[11:33.920 --> 11:38.880]  that. Wouldn't that be right, Lisa? Yes. Yeah. Hey, Lisa. In all situations. Yeah, absolutely. Lisa,
[11:38.880 --> 11:42.320]  should I play T Higgins this weekend? And two, what gift would you recommend? I get this girl.
[11:42.320 --> 11:46.000]  I've been seeing for a few weeks for Christmas. I'm terrible at gifts. Thanks. That's from Big
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.040]  Tough. Oh yeah. That's a good one. You know, if it's only a couple of weeks, you can go with
[11:19.440 --> 11:27.760]  safety thing that they're doing. I have no idea. How do you warm up 150 airplanes on the outside?
[11:28.640 --> 11:35.200]  How are you equipped with handling ice storms? Is it just because they had to ground a bunch of
[11:35.200 --> 11:41.040]  planes? They had computer problems and they couldn't get pilots and the flight staff,
[11:41.040 --> 11:45.360]  they couldn't get them to airports. Was it due to weather? The weather had something to it and they
[11:55.920 --> 12:01.040]  But there's a couple of fishermen in there. It wouldn't be even needed if it was just going
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.800]  to be to recognize the greatest professional athletes. They already have a Hall of Fame.
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.440]  Well, what would be the point of it? Well, it's for an area Hall of Fame.
[12:09.440 --> 12:12.720]  Right, and that's what it is. So if you put Ozzy in there, he played for the St. Louis Cardinals.
[12:12.720 --> 12:17.040]  That's talking about playing for it. I know, but based on that, you could make it all Cardinals,
[12:17.040 --> 12:21.360]  all Royals, all Chiefs, Rams, football Cardinals, Blues. And then what's the point? Yeah, coaches
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.200]  something very simple, like a candle. Something that you'll have. You know, your mom got me those
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.320]  amazing candles that I traveled with. Oh, that's right. And I love them so much. A candle is a super
[12:02.320 --> 12:07.120]  nice and simple gift and a special scent or something. It's easy because you don't want to
[12:07.120 --> 12:12.080]  feel pressured to buy something in a new relationship both ways, right? Both of you don't
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.000]  want to feel like one of you overspent on the other one and you'll enjoy time together,
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.840]  plan something that you like to do, whether it's going bowling or going to a game or going to a
[11:45.360 --> 11:49.440]  had major computer meltdown. Okay, say if it's just their computer malfunctioning, they definitely
[11:49.440 --> 11:53.840]  own them. You got to have an IT team there, Doug. They've changed. Well, I understand, but lots of
[11:53.840 --> 11:59.920]  businesses have computer meltdowns. They don't get hit with $140 million fine. Yeah, that's a tough
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.440]  find. What if you got a McDonald's? I'm gonna have three quarter pounders. You're gonna have to come
[12:03.440 --> 12:09.120]  inside. Our computer isn't working. But I bet if you- Fine, fine. $8 million. Our computer sometimes
[12:09.120 --> 12:15.200]  doesn't work. Should we be fined? I hope not. But in that situation, look at their annual revenue,
[12:21.360 --> 12:24.560]  and put maybe two or three in, but you don't because you have to fill tables and make money.
[12:24.560 --> 12:29.440]  I get it. I just think it's kind of a watered down Hall of Fame when you're putting all these
[12:29.440 --> 12:36.080]  errors and fishermen in because they're going to buy tables and make money. It's a money grab.
[12:36.080 --> 12:40.480]  What kind of lure was this? Catching all these lunches? Probably a brown Marabu jig.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.480]  Not just anybody can attach that to the line. Well, I can't. I've caught many trout. Can I go in?
[12:15.200 --> 12:20.080]  look at their net worth in comparison to the fine and it's probably reasonable. Well, I'm just
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.920]  wondering if any fine is reasonable just because you had a computer issue or if it's because the
[12:25.920 --> 12:31.440]  government oversees it, the FAA oversees it, they have that right to fine them. Unless they found
[12:31.440 --> 12:40.000]  something else that it was, you know, something was done on purpose. Oh, it wasn't that. It wasn't
[12:19.840 --> 12:23.680]  movie. And that's what we should be thinking about. We should all be thinking about less gifts
[12:23.680 --> 12:28.080]  and more experiences with our friends. Love that perspective there, Lisa. And I think that's spot
[12:28.080 --> 12:34.080]  on. Lisa, two-parter. Pick two of these three, Zeke, Kenneth Walker, and Ty Chandler. And two,
[12:34.080 --> 12:38.560]  it's my first official Christmas with my father-in-law. So I got him a flesh line as a stocking
[12:38.560 --> 12:43.440]  stuffer. Oh sure. That question's okay, but mine wasn't. Would it be weird if I tested it out before
[12:43.440 --> 12:47.840]  wrapping it? It feels like a power move and it would fun to be Eskimo bros. Thanks. Ah, the horny
[12:46.480 --> 12:49.520]  So should you be in the fishing Hall of Fame as well? I should go in as a fisherman,
[12:50.480 --> 12:53.360]  bowler, broadcaster. Now, if your name showed up on the list this year,
[12:53.360 --> 12:56.800]  would you be downgrading this Hall of Fame class? Yeah, because I...
[12:58.560 --> 13:06.800]  I mean, I won't go in. And if I did, I wouldn't accept. No, no. Do you think that discrediting
[13:06.800 --> 13:12.880]  some of other people's Hall of Fame credentials would then in turn bring up people questioning
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.040]  a time in that period where pilots weren't showing up. They were all just calling in sick and-
[12:47.040 --> 12:51.200]  They had all kinds of problems, but most of it got back to their computer. They had an old computer
[12:51.200 --> 12:55.360]  system. Well, then that could be a fine. You need to upgrade your system. It's like the Rams lost a
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.120]  football team because they didn't upgrade their stadium. But the government didn't find the Williams.
[13:01.520 --> 13:08.240]  Well, crying, you gotta find. That was a court case. Can the government just find any company
[12:47.840 --> 12:55.520]  banker. It's the horny banker, Doug. Okay, so here we are. I'm definitely going to go,
[12:55.520 --> 13:00.400]  and I do think you are going to use it before you give it as a gift. It's very tricky to open
[13:00.400 --> 13:05.120]  without opening it from the bottom of the box because then you can pop it back in because
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.040]  that's how I used to open them to sign them and put them back together. But please make sure that
[13:09.040 --> 13:15.040]  you clean it and dry it properly or it could have a strange cell in your face.
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.040]  your Hall of Fame credentials? Do you think you're walking a slippery slope here?
[13:17.040 --> 13:22.000]  Well, I can't question my credentials. Why? I mean, I've gone into two specific Hall of Fames
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  for what I do. I went into the Brentwood High School Hall of Fame because I went to Brentwood
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.600]  High School. For doing what, though? So all my people from Brentwood High School get in there.
[13:31.120 --> 13:34.320]  But what did you do to get into the Brentwood Hall of Fame? I've done a lot of things.
[13:34.320 --> 13:39.760]  Like? My career. Like what? 30 plus years in broadcasting. But that's just getting old.
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.680]  that has a problem? The FCC, I guess, can. They can find you because you cuss. Well, the FCC can,
[13:13.680 --> 13:18.800]  but this is the- You can say we don't, it's not the same thing, but the FCC can find us if we cuss.
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.000]  Yeah. They have the rules and regulations. If there's a rule that says you have to update
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.160]  your computer system, they don't. It's because we're licensed. Acknowledgy and stuff. I suppose
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.400]  it must be because the airlines have to be licensed by the FAA that that gives the government the right
[13:32.400 --> 13:37.680]  to fine them. It must be it. So the FAA probably has the same type of regulations FCC does. If you
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.480]  Yeah. I'm going to play Zeke. When it comes to Walker and Chandler, man, they've both been
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.800]  stealing so much of each other, but I like Walker better. So I'm going to go with Zeke and Walker
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.240]  for these two. Congratulations on getting into the championship to whoever this lovely lister is.
[13:30.240 --> 13:33.280]  Yeah, that's good. Good call there, Lisa. Here's Doug. Here's a question.
[13:33.280 --> 13:36.960]  I doubt he's lovely. Here's a question you'll like. Hi, we used to hand Cortland
[13:36.960 --> 13:40.800]  Sudden or Terry McLaren. And two, what are your thoughts on docking? That's from William Howard
[13:39.760 --> 13:46.160]  That's showing up for working, getting old. Philanthropy working. Oh, God. And the St. Louis
[13:46.160 --> 13:51.360]  USBC Bowling Hall of Fame, which nobody promoted the game of bowling more than I did for 20 plus
[13:51.360 --> 13:56.080]  years with Kegeler's Corner. And my coaching career. And my coaching career. But those are
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.800]  specific Hall of Fames. You destroyed an entire program in college. Those are specific Hall of
[14:00.800 --> 14:06.720]  Fames. You got... you point to your coaching career, you destroyed a program at Fontbond University.
[13:40.800 --> 13:47.600]  Tuft. What does docking mean? What is it? I feel like now I feel like the one who's
[13:47.600 --> 13:52.560]  the only this is on me. What is it? Docking. Boy, the FCC.
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.680]  Okay. Well, this is something that I don't know about. It was Terry McLaren and who else?
[14:00.720 --> 14:07.520]  Cortland Sudden. Oh, man. Cortland Sudden's been so good, but New England's defense has really
[13:37.680 --> 13:43.040]  don't follow them, they can fine you. And they probably said your system is not upgraded. That's
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.840]  why all this stuff happened. So we're fineing you. People are agreeing with Iggy here on the
[13:47.840 --> 13:53.200]  EDF Group Text inbox. Johnny Johnson says, Johnny Johnson, Doug, airlines were fine because the
[13:53.200 --> 13:57.680]  government gave the money to update their computer systems and they did not. Dirty Chewbacca rings
[13:57.680 --> 14:02.640]  the similar sentiment when he says Southwest was using an old computer system. The FAA told them
[14:02.640 --> 14:06.960]  they need to upgrade and they didn't. And then their system crashed. That was Dirty Chewbacca.
[14:06.720 --> 14:13.040]  If I was put into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, I would say, yeah, you can go ahead and
[14:13.040 --> 14:18.640]  poo-poo me all you want because probably not the coordinates. But with some of these other people
[14:18.640 --> 14:22.800]  going in, I mean, it can't be any worse than Marty Prather going in because he holds a sign in a
[14:22.800 --> 14:27.760]  baseball game. Okay. Nothing against Marty again. I love Marty. But it seems like you're saying
[14:27.760 --> 14:32.480]  anybody who gets old should be in the Hall of Fame. No, I'm not. I'm comparing it to other
[14:07.520 --> 14:12.640]  picked up. But where is Terry McQuarren been this season? What has he been doing? Because he hasn't
[14:12.640 --> 14:17.280]  done enough to get me into the playoffs, the championship in the leaks, right? I'm going to
[14:17.280 --> 14:23.280]  go Cortland Sudden here because I don't like Terry McLaren against the Jets defense. So you're going
[14:23.280 --> 14:29.520]  to Cortland Sudden. I looked up docking and says to tie up at a dock, especially in order to load or
[14:29.520 --> 14:35.200]  upload passengers or cargo. The ship docked at San Francisco. No, no, no, no, no. I think more
[14:08.320 --> 14:11.440]  That's completely not true. They overbooked every flight knowing that they didn't have the
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.640]  career support the number of flights booked. That's from Hey Man, He Man. So they weren't fine for
[14:16.640 --> 14:21.920]  that I don't believe. They had problems all over the country I remember. Well we didn't have any
[14:21.920 --> 14:26.080]  problems when we were flying down there. No we did not because we're special. Just in Charlotte.
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.320]  Yeah but that was a that was a well that's the government that's great they have
[14:32.320 --> 14:37.600]  customs 700 people in line and there's two customs agents working. I'm surprised we didn't fly
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.680]  of like a Chinese finger trap. Here I'll do. Here's how I'll do it. So you know in fancy
[14:39.680 --> 14:45.040]  football, two guys will have a head to head matchup. Oh, wow. You know how you have a head
[14:45.040 --> 14:48.800]  to head matchup with somebody in your fantasy league? It's the same idea with docking.
[14:50.320 --> 14:51.200]  It's the same idea.
[14:55.440 --> 14:58.960]  I would click on images, of course. Yeah, I'm sorry you had to hear that.
[14:32.480 --> 14:38.480]  people going in. I compared it to... Claiborne has had a great career in broadcasting. So has
[14:38.480 --> 14:43.440]  Wendy Wiese. But so have you. Not like those guys. So why aren't you... what has Wendy Wiese done
[14:43.440 --> 14:46.880]  better than what you've done? She's been on the number one... she was on the number one radio station
[14:46.880 --> 14:51.280]  for many, many years. Oh, you're on the number one HD2 station. Yeah. Pretty big difference.
[14:51.280 --> 14:56.320]  And you were KAMOV for all those years. But I was just there. I just showed up. She's just there.
[14:57.360 --> 15:01.520]  Claib's just there doing KAMOVAC. She's just there in the broadcast booth. Well, I suppose doing the
[14:37.680 --> 14:44.800]  PJ. Yeah for real a fractional. We should find someone for that. Yeah. Yeah can we make money
[14:44.800 --> 14:52.320]  off of that somehow? We should fine over. I remember flying from Denver home this is like
[14:52.320 --> 14:55.840]  the one time I about missed a flight and there were non-refundable tickets so like it was super
[14:55.840 --> 15:01.600]  stressful. And there were literally two baggage workers but they had like a VIP this is frontier
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.440]  by the way so let me preface by saying that. But they had this like VIP or rewards program
[14:59.600 --> 15:08.400]  Yeah, not ideal. I appreciate everyone sharing this with me and enlightening me. I feel very
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.520]  much like a boomer right now that I didn't know about that. And I need to process the information
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.760]  before I can really give any perspective. Yeah, that's one you got to mull over for a little bit
[15:17.760 --> 15:23.360]  because it's certainly we don't kink shame by any means. But I do certainly. No, some of you got
[15:23.360 --> 15:27.440]  mull over. You don't want to just go off. I was going to say half cocked, but that would be a poor
[15:01.520 --> 15:06.880]  Cardinal play by play probably put him over the top. Yeah, but he's only been doing play by play
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.200]  for a few years. Please make him stop. This is borderline idiocy. This has been six three six.
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.920]  Why is it idiocy? Why don't you call in and... Are you upset because you're not in it? Is that what it is?
[15:15.920 --> 15:22.000]  No, I'm not. Well, I'm just as old or even older than you. And I don't think I should be in just
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.360]  because I got old. Just because I showed up for work. I probably started poo pooing it when Ned
[15:08.240 --> 15:13.920]  no one's in it. There's one worker waiting for frontier rewards members. I didn't know that
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.320]  existed. That's like double diamond for Six Flags. I didn't know that existed. Which you are a member.
[15:18.320 --> 15:23.600]  Which I am. Yeah. And blessed to be so. Bingo. But like I'm thinking can't that worker just like
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.520]  you know act like this isn't just a normal line and it's not like for VIPs that aren't clear and
[15:29.520 --> 15:33.360]  not the frontier you're paying for the bare minimum. You're not paying extra for the bare
[15:27.440 --> 15:32.320]  use of that work there. You go to search something and you look and there's already millions of
[15:32.320 --> 15:37.680]  results and you're like, where was I when these millions were being produced? Why did I not know
[15:37.680 --> 15:42.640]  about this? How what rock have I been under? Well, time passes us all by at some point.
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.880]  Doug's a grandfather. Yeah, Lisa Anna, the Seahawks for real. I think it comes down to coaching.
[15:48.880 --> 15:52.880]  And second question, what NFL quarterback would be most fun to give a prostate exam?
[15:27.360 --> 15:31.360]  Rommel started doing the inductions. And I just got tired of seeing him every time. Sit there for
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.320]  three hours. And now we go to Kickapoo High School. People that I've covered 50 years ago.
[15:37.040 --> 15:42.800]  Johnny Johnson. Johnny Johnson. Is he in the hall of fame? Johnny, Johnny, I'm sure there's five or six
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.440]  Johnny Johnson's in there. Anyway, there you go. There's the induction. There's the
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.600]  Mr. Fisher. Well, that was a tight little ball on that one. That'll put everybody in a good mood.
[15:51.600 --> 15:54.800]  And I think there's another group that comes out in the middle of the year. They put another group
[15:33.440 --> 15:37.840]  minimum. You're just this is a last minute booking. We almost went for a flight because they only had
[15:37.840 --> 15:44.800]  two baggage workers and one was sitting there waiting for a VIP frontier member to get in line.
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.280]  Well it's been hard for a lot of places to find. It's terrible. I don't blame them. I'm just saying
[15:49.280 --> 15:54.240]  wouldn't it be smart to maybe go hey I see about 50 people in line. They look pretty stressed. Let
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.800]  me get in there and if there's somebody that comes in my line I'll come back. Did anybody else's
[15:52.880 --> 16:00.240]  That's from Professor Roy Hinkley. Fair question. I mean, to keep it local, I would think the exam
[16:00.240 --> 16:05.280]  would be best on Joe Burrow because he so much mimics our friend Jackson right there in studio.
[16:06.240 --> 16:10.640]  So I think everyone could just close their eyes and be the same image. You feel the same around
[16:10.640 --> 16:15.760]  Joe Burrow as you do around Jackson. So that's going to be my choice. I picked the Seahawks
[16:15.760 --> 16:20.800]  to win the game Monday night. And I really thought Jalen Hurts going there sick going to wear down
[15:58.800 --> 16:03.840]  passport not get stamped? Mine got stamped. I have no idea. I don't know where mine is.
[16:04.640 --> 16:10.400]  Mine got stamped. That Jamaica trip gave us the gift that will never stop giving the big yellow
[16:10.400 --> 16:14.960]  dipi that was strapped upon our wispy virgin boy. That's from little Tommy Trippin. We still have
[16:14.960 --> 16:20.720]  it right here. That that's right here. That flotation device and that picture spurred my
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.040]  my lifestyle change to drop some weight. So if anything I guess I'm thankful for it. Would you
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.360]  in and they have their inductions all over the place. St. Louis, Springfield, Kansas City. They
[15:59.360 --> 16:04.640]  just start doing inductions everywhere. He's upset because he hates anyone that gets recognition or
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.640]  success. That's from Tracy Woodson. Oh yeah, that's what I do. I hate everybody that gets success.
[16:08.640 --> 16:14.080]  That's what I do. Nothing against any of the nominees or process at all, but it's just crap
[16:14.080 --> 16:18.640]  to sell tables. I know a lot about Hall of Fame's and it's great. That comes from Carlos Spicywaiter.
[16:20.240 --> 16:23.520]  I call him with my list of children who are getting Christmas gifts but really don't deserve
[16:20.800 --> 16:27.040]  by the second half. But regardless, it's Pete Carroll when I'm so unsure about what could be
[16:27.040 --> 16:31.040]  happening with players injuries both in the quarterback. You know, it's not playing. I'll
[16:31.040 --> 16:34.480]  go and say, who do I think is better coach? I think the Eagles are really missing their
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.680]  coordinators that they lost at the Super Bowl. And I think it's showing right now, whereas Pete
[16:39.680 --> 16:45.760]  Carroll, 72 years old, that man looks so incredible and just a great leader. And you know, players
[16:25.040 --> 16:29.440]  like to take this home and hang it up on your mantle? No. And Jackson is one of those life
[16:29.440 --> 16:37.200]  lessons because Tim commended me for saying oh hell no I'm not doing that. F-ing S. And you learn
[16:37.200 --> 16:43.280]  that from experience because I have been subjected on this show to some some extremely embarrassing
[16:43.280 --> 16:48.160]  no-win situation type things. Really? Yeah sometimes you gotta shovel some mud Doug. Yeah.
[16:48.160 --> 16:50.800]  Sometimes you just gotta sit there you gotta shovel mud. Well how were you embarrassed
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.000]  them. That comes from Anoop Ball Eligible. Well, that's up to you. I mean, it's your kids.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  I would hope that Wendy Wiese would refuse her induction. She simply hasn't earned it yet.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.760]  Thanks. It's from Scott's Wrinkle Ball Sack. I didn't say that. Wendy Wiese is well-deserving.
[16:37.760 --> 16:42.960]  I work with Wendy a little bit. I know Wendy. She's a fantastic human being and is very good
[16:42.960 --> 16:48.160]  at what she does. She's well-deserving to go in. I just said why isn't Doug in? We have another
[16:48.160 --> 16:52.960]  very fantastic human being who sponsors this presentation. Doug, amongst many outstanding
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.880]  don't want to leave that team. And we've seen players leave and come back. There is something
[16:50.880 --> 16:55.600]  in that organization that brings out the best in players and makes them really enjoy their careers.
[16:56.320 --> 17:00.320]  It's great to hear. And it's great to see. So I do think the Seahawks have the potential to be real.
[17:00.880 --> 17:06.960]  There it is. Dear Lisa Ann, I have a rare three parter big fan. I won your book from a charity
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.840]  run by our very own human leather Tanner. Question one, will Aaron Jones hit his projected points?
[17:11.840 --> 17:17.600]  Question two, was your favorite Christmas Eve event slash tradition slash meal and sweet,
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.560]  sweet Jackson, what have you taught him both physically and emotionally? Thank you and happy
[17:22.560 --> 17:30.080]  holidays. That comes from Brad. We're going to go into reverse here. Jackson needed nothing but to
[17:30.080 --> 17:35.440]  be reminded how incredibly awesome he is. And talent recognizes talent. So it's important for
[16:51.440 --> 16:56.000]  I don't know I did the stand-up thing. It's just it's hard to think about like a lot of different
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.160]  examples but I know there are. The mile run I killed that's not an embarrassment. Body
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.960]  that accomplishment body that absolute athleticism at its finest right there Doug. You're talking
[17:04.960 --> 17:10.080]  about it. I thought so. But yeah next time we go on the trips you know what you're not going to do
[17:10.080 --> 17:15.440]  volunteer to jump in and then that's when you go back to that cumberbond and you go hey. Yeah I
[16:52.960 --> 16:57.200]  human beings, that's James Carlton. He's the Plow Hawks guy. He's many of our listeners.
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.200]  He should be in the insurance hall. His true son is what he is. Plow Hawk, can I hear a little bit
[17:01.200 --> 17:06.000]  about our friend James Carlton who brings us here? James Carlton of the Carlton State Farm
[17:06.000 --> 17:12.800]  Insurance Agency in Webster Groves is my insurance agent. He's the Plow Hawks insurance agent and I
[17:12.800 --> 17:18.960]  would love for him to become your insurance agent as well. And there is a reason I say that because
[17:35.440 --> 17:42.160]  someone like myself to remind the people in my sphere how exceptional they are. That's Jackson.
[17:42.160 --> 17:47.040]  Thank you. My favorite Christmas meal, you know, as an Italian, we grew up, you would go to your
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.480]  grandparents the night before Christmas. And we had to eat tripe. And it was so traumatizing.
[17:52.480 --> 17:56.960]  It's like intestines, right? Yeah, it's like intestine. And we would, you would see your
[17:56.960 --> 18:01.600]  grandmother making it raw, like it's in a bowl. And I don't know what it was like before it was
[17:18.960 --> 17:23.040]  I have learned that there is a difference between what James Carlton and his staff do
[17:23.680 --> 17:30.480]  and a lot of other insurance agencies. And that is putting customer service at the absolute top
[17:30.480 --> 17:39.280]  of the list of priorities. And now that's why they have 339 five-star reviews when you search
[17:39.280 --> 17:45.120]  James Carlton and the Carlton State Farm Insurance Agency on Google. This one posted just a week ago,
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.720]  recently switched to James and he set up a meeting with me instantly to go over my coverage
[17:15.520 --> 17:20.560]  was riding the high of the Iowa State win and uh it was a good win. Good win. Good win. View
[17:20.560 --> 17:25.120]  umbrella drinks. Oh yeah Pina Colada's left and right Doug. Nothing wrong with that. Oh I like
[17:25.120 --> 17:28.960]  a boat drink on the beach. Uh guys I didn't know Frontier Airlines was a real thing. That's from
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.120]  Orson Woods Wacko. It was the only time of actually because I'm usually a South Wacko. I've
[17:33.120 --> 17:39.360]  flown America in a few times but mostly Southwest. Frontier it just happened to be a great it timed
[17:39.360 --> 17:44.240]  out well for how our vacation was we were able to fly out early in Denver so get St. Louis in the
[18:01.600 --> 18:06.560]  cooked. I could normally eat it as a kid. And it was so traumatizing. We were only allowed to eat
[18:06.560 --> 18:12.880]  fish. And it was just like a whole night thing of fish and pasta and tripe. So now I eat what I want.
[18:12.880 --> 18:17.600]  I'm actually going out for a fancy dinner with Joanna Angel and small hands for Christmas.
[18:19.600 --> 18:23.920]  Yes, very excited. We went we found a place they have a nice pre-fixed menu. We're going to sit
[18:23.920 --> 18:31.360]  there all night and eat and drink. And Sunday is a no Christmas day is a no alarm clock day on Monday.
[17:48.720 --> 17:53.680]  during our meeting. James informed us of the drive and save discount which I was never even
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.320]  aware of before. We went over the rest of my coverage in extensive detail which I had never
[17:58.320 --> 18:04.880]  had an agent do before. Very happy with my decision to switch to James Carlton. As am I,
[18:04.880 --> 18:11.600]  that posted on Google and it's one of 339 five-star reviews. The number for James Carlton's agency
[18:11.600 --> 18:17.600]  314-961-4800 or go online at CarltonInsurance.net. If your insurance calls the leg at arm,
[17:44.240 --> 17:50.720]  afternoon because we had to work the next day at least I did and it just I'll never you know maybe
[17:50.720 --> 17:56.160]  this is just a one-time experience it's not a shot and trying to drag the entire airline but that
[17:56.160 --> 17:59.840]  experience was not worth it. I would have paid a little bit more money to be itself. Remember that
[17:59.840 --> 18:07.120]  old airlines I think it was the Cardinals used as a charter Ozark airline. Yeah. It just sounded like
[18:17.600 --> 18:22.720]  call James Carlton State Farm. That's James Carlton, a wonderful sponsor to show. He brings
[18:22.720 --> 18:29.440]  us Gabe every Monday. I got text Gabe that we're not doing the hit today at 10 15. Why not?
[18:29.440 --> 18:37.520]  His Tim is off at the pooling party. So we have Friday Follux with Josh. We'll do something. I'm
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.080]  not sure what. I know that this is our last presentation of 2023 which means this will
[18:31.440 --> 18:35.200]  And I'm really looking forward to it. I hope that Aaron Jones gets his projected points,
[18:35.200 --> 18:41.040]  man. So guarantees anymore right now in Green Bay. Yeah, it's goat tripe, right? And that's
[18:41.040 --> 18:47.120]  intestines? I thought it was beef. I think it's beef. I don't know. It was so traumatic as a child.
[18:47.120 --> 18:53.920]  I've heard of goat tripe. And it's raw intestines. What's an intestine? Nothing good, right? You cook it,
[18:53.920 --> 18:58.960]  but you do cook it. You do cook it. It's Italian tradition. We're so desperate for food. We're
[18:07.120 --> 18:14.240]  a Cooterville operation. Yeah that was around for a while in the TWA days. Hey Iggy what
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.080]  was the best flavor of baby food to add to a Christmas spread. I'm partial to the banana
[18:20.080 --> 18:25.520]  but I haven't had in 35 years so what do I do now that comes from fuel? Apricot. The strain
[18:25.520 --> 18:30.560]  peaches and the oatmeal is pretty good too. Tapioca. Instant oatmeal. I forgot about the baby food.
[18:30.560 --> 18:34.960]  So you so you do you still do that? Every once in a while. You still eat baby food?
[18:42.160 --> 18:47.760]  be our last program before both Missouri takes on Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl and before the
[18:47.760 --> 18:53.200]  college football playoff. Doug, the numbers are as follows. Missouri is now getting a point and a
[18:53.200 --> 19:00.960]  half against Ohio State as they play on December 29th at 7 p.m. in Dallas, Texas. Arlington, I guess.
[19:00.960 --> 19:06.160]  Is that where Jerry World is? Yeah, it is. So they're now getting a point. That line has moved like
[18:58.960 --> 19:05.440]  going to eat the intestine, the digestive organs of a goat. Yeah. I mean, something spiritual
[19:05.440 --> 19:10.240]  about something that none of us pay attention to. We just wanted it to go away. We all ended that
[19:10.240 --> 19:15.120]  tradition. Yeah, I guess worst case, you could use some of it to do some re-sleaving, Doug.
[19:15.840 --> 19:20.880]  What does that mean? Take that for what you will. If you have told my 14 year old self that I would
[19:20.880 --> 19:25.360]  educate the legendary Lisa Anna what docking is, I would have simply passed away. That was from the
[18:35.680 --> 18:38.640]  Every once in a while. Aren't the portions just like really small? Yeah it's just a little
[18:39.440 --> 18:45.200]  I mean a little thing of yogurt. Doesn't it taste horrible? Yeah we yogurts are almost like the same
[18:45.200 --> 18:49.200]  size as well as the black containers so sometimes it feels like you're eating. The bananas used to
[18:49.200 --> 18:55.040]  be pretty good and the peaches but the box of Gerber oatmeal is always good. Oh why don't you
[18:55.040 --> 19:00.400]  just get regular a big boy oatmeal because I like the taste of it. But it probably tastes about the
[19:06.160 --> 19:12.400]  it's opened up at Ohio State minus six and a half and then got all the way down to Missouri
[19:12.400 --> 19:17.680]  minus two and a half and has now popped back up, I assume, because a lot of the Ohio State guys are
[19:17.680 --> 19:23.360]  actually playing and now the Buck guys are minus one and a half. I think the Tigers are going to
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.400]  come out and play this like the Super Bowl. So probably, I don't know why you wouldn't.
[19:28.400 --> 19:32.000]  Right. For a lot of them it'll be their last college game. They're going to play in front of
[19:25.360 --> 19:32.160]  text you talked about docking. William Howard Tuft. Thank you, William Howard Tuft, for bringing me
[19:32.160 --> 19:39.920]  into something new every day of the school day. Yeah, absolutely. Send in your two-part quest
[19:39.920 --> 19:44.880]  with Lisa Ann. Bring the heat as always. Lisa, what about New Year's? What's New Year's in
[19:44.880 --> 19:50.400]  Manhattan looking like for you this year? So, you know, pretty much the city is just alive,
[19:50.400 --> 19:54.160]  no matter where you are. My neighbors, my building and I get together. We have a big event in the
[19:00.400 --> 19:06.960]  same. Did you bring my M&Ms? So you're shopping in the baby food aisle? No I'm not shopping in it.
[19:06.960 --> 19:12.720]  If I go by and I see it south I haven't had one in a while just pick one up. I don't know why
[19:12.720 --> 19:15.760]  because you know Doug some people like things some people don't like other things you know
[19:15.760 --> 19:22.080]  kink shame very open-minded presentation. I kink. But buying baby food is I can't I can't
[19:22.080 --> 19:25.440]  get my head around that. Maybe they think I have a kid. I'm sure they don't think it's for me.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.920]  a huge crowd at one of the nicest stadiums in the world. Last hurrah, I don't know why you
[19:37.920 --> 19:42.800]  wouldn't give everything you got. Absolutely, yeah. A lot of those guys probably never play again.
[19:43.440 --> 19:50.640]  Yeah, most. 60 something. The total is what you're asking me for, Iggs. The total is 48 and a half.
[19:50.640 --> 19:55.440]  The Mizzou fans are going to need binoculars to see this one. Yeah, so I got, what was it? The Mizzou,
[19:55.440 --> 20:00.160]  the tickets Mizzou gave out were in what, the 400s. Yeah, boy. My friends that are going down
[19:54.160 --> 20:02.160]  building. I have been granted the great honor to dog sit for my favorite doodle in the building.
[20:02.160 --> 20:07.840]  So for New Year's Eve, I will be with Archie. I have Archie for five days. We're going to do a
[20:07.840 --> 20:13.680]  lot of New York City activities. I found out all the places where I can take Archie. MoMA, I'm
[20:13.680 --> 20:18.240]  going to take Archie to MoMA. We're going to go walk around Saxons Avenue because I've always
[20:18.240 --> 20:22.960]  wanted to be one of those ladies carrying a dog looking fancy. Oh, yeah. We're going to be out
[19:26.160 --> 19:31.920]  I don't know if they think you have a kid I think if more no fancy like 60 maybe for a grand kid.
[19:31.920 --> 19:36.240]  Maybe they think you have your teeth. I'm sure they see when I talk I have teeth.
[19:38.960 --> 19:43.680]  Look at this look at that. I think yeah I don't know what they would think. It really makes no
[19:43.680 --> 19:48.720]  sense. They probably don't think anything they see 10,000 items go by and they hit it with the scanner
[19:48.720 --> 19:54.480]  and there's not a whole lot of thought comes into it. Oh yeah. I haven't had in a while. I don't
[20:00.160 --> 20:04.000]  are going to be watching that game on that giant screen. You can't help but watch it on the screen.
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.920]  No. It's darn near the entire length of the field. Yeah, I went to the last Cotton Bowl down there
[20:07.920 --> 20:13.200]  and sat up there and I said never again. Are you going KG this time around? I have a flight,
[20:13.200 --> 20:17.760]  but I don't have a game ticket yet. I'm not sitting in the 400s. Yeah, I feel that. We're
[20:17.760 --> 20:22.560]  going to go all the way down there. I'd sooner save the money and go to like
[20:23.040 --> 20:28.560]  in the town. You will get some really great social media content. Trust me, I've already also
[20:28.560 --> 20:32.560]  ordered Archie some clothes that when we go out, he's going to sit at the table with me and look
[20:32.560 --> 20:38.160]  fly. And you can walk around New York. It's safe to do that. Even if he didn't have a dog, would it
[20:38.160 --> 20:43.040]  be safe? I don't think Archie is going to protect me. It depends where you are in the city, Doug.
[20:43.040 --> 20:49.360]  It depends when, right? I live in a good area. We know where to go and where not to go, but there's
[19:54.480 --> 19:58.240]  remember a hemorrhoid one time and had to I remember listening during that and like
[19:59.760 --> 20:04.000]  I typically don't go into the store for a lot of things so when I did it was just for
[20:04.880 --> 20:09.440]  the cream and the powder preparation each. I've never had one before so I wanted to kind of weigh
[20:09.440 --> 20:14.080]  out what would work you know going forward again want to make sure that was a learning experience
[20:14.080 --> 20:19.120]  I knew which one worked. Applying hemorrhoid cream is a humbling experience. Especially through
[20:23.040 --> 20:30.960]  circo, tusker lusas, circo, go to tusker lusa on next year or go to Austin when they eventually
[20:30.960 --> 20:36.640]  play Texas at Longhorn stadium and flights aren't so crazy. I feel like a game with like a little
[20:36.640 --> 20:40.400]  bit more meaning. I understand that the Cotton Bowl is really awesome and I don't want to come
[20:40.400 --> 20:45.360]  across like I'm poo pooing it because it would be a very good win for Missouri to beat Ohio State,
[20:45.360 --> 20:51.120]  finish 11 and two probably finish in the top seven maybe, but ultimately I'm more into a game that
[20:49.360 --> 20:54.160]  definitely places that are not safe and that you take a car instead of walking, that you may
[20:54.160 --> 21:00.000]  have walked before. It's a little bit wild. There's no doubt. Yeah, I've heard it is. But I'm in a
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.920]  good spot. My little fear in which I walk is such a safe, great area that I feel really good about
[21:05.920 --> 21:12.400]  it. Luckily, I don't have to walk any well. Okay. That's the great Lisa Ann joining us. Lisa, we are
[21:12.400 --> 21:17.200]  off next week, so there will be no Fancy Football Friday. This is it. Yeah, this is it for the
[20:19.120 --> 20:23.520]  thick matted tufts. It's like trying to grab a golf ball through like a thick little form bush.
[20:23.520 --> 20:30.800]  Yeah. Is it worth it? Yeah. Take an unplayable. Did it work? It did work. Like if you catch them
[20:30.800 --> 20:33.680]  early you don't have to go to the doctor or anything I think like the powder and the
[20:33.680 --> 20:37.680]  cream work but I'm telling you it I would have I would have really liked to sit on a
[20:37.680 --> 20:41.760]  cummerbund that week. Oh do you think it was because you were sitting for too long? Because
[20:41.760 --> 20:46.400]  I know I've heard that's how sometimes I think it's usually straining when you try to go to the
[20:51.200 --> 20:57.040]  could lead to a championship than a bowl game, an exhibition game, but I'm excited that Mizzou
[20:57.040 --> 21:01.360]  fans are excited, like super excited. That's good. It's good for the hype to be around there.
[21:02.480 --> 21:07.040]  You know, so I'm excited. When we talked yesterday, I feel like some of the luster wore off with the
[21:07.040 --> 21:13.760]  layoff. Yeah, I think that's just the nature of college football is like you kind of forget about
[21:13.760 --> 21:17.680]  it for a little bit, but once it comes back, I've tried watching a couple of these bowl games that
[21:17.200 --> 21:22.400]  season. We're done. I get to have my Fridays back. You just sleep in a little bit. I'll catch up with
[21:22.400 --> 21:27.840]  you through the year when big things happen. But for all of you and your listeners, happy holidays,
[21:27.840 --> 21:34.480]  enjoy time with your loved ones, do what you want to do, watch the games. Just be grateful and have
[21:34.480 --> 21:39.680]  a nice holiday season. Absolutely. That's the great Lisa Ann. Thank you as always, Lisa Ann. Another
[21:39.680 --> 21:44.320]  great season in the books. We appreciate you. Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
[20:46.400 --> 20:52.320]  bathroom. I think no. I was putting in that work. Well it was when I moved I think it was the time
[20:52.320 --> 20:58.480]  so like I'm picking loading boxes up and going up and down stairs lifting like you know I'm 115
[20:58.480 --> 21:03.040]  pounds anything is a heavy lifting item for me typically so if I'm getting down try to lift the
[21:03.040 --> 21:07.120]  couch with my boy and I'm trying to give just as much strength. But that shouldn't affect your rectum.
[21:07.120 --> 21:12.720]  Rectum down here killed him. Nice. Hernias are in that area right? They're that the same
[21:17.680 --> 21:23.040]  are played with teams I don't care about. Oh yeah, you can't watch. There's no atmosphere,
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.040]  which is like the coolest part of college football. You have no idea who's trying or who's not or who's
[21:27.040 --> 21:30.640]  playing. Yeah, I'd be looking forward to a lot of these games come up if you knew they're playing.
[21:30.640 --> 21:37.280]  I mean, I would love to watch USC and Louisville play. Caleb Williams playing, I don't know.
[21:37.920 --> 21:44.080]  I mean, are any of these players going to play LSU? Is neighbors playing? Are these people playing?
[21:45.280 --> 21:51.520]  You as well. Take care, everybody. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Gail. That's Lisa Ann for her wonderful
[21:51.520 --> 21:56.960]  Fancy Football Friday segment. This is the morning after presented to you by Brown and
[21:56.960 --> 22:01.440]  Crippen. We'll have the design, air, heating and cooling email of the day coming up about 9 45. You
[22:01.440 --> 22:05.680]  can send that out on in the morning after at insidestl.com. If you want to join via the phone
[22:05.680 --> 22:11.280]  lines before we head out of here for the year, you can call in 636-904-TMA. And as always,
[21:13.440 --> 21:18.080]  thing. Yeah that's more like what you might have strained Hernia by picking something up that was
[21:18.080 --> 21:23.760]  too heavy. I don't think you get him. Nonetheless the hemorrhoid cream buying just that at the store
[21:24.480 --> 21:29.280]  you know with the powder so she knows. Did you pick a few more items to try to hide? A York
[21:29.280 --> 21:35.120]  peppermint patty. I always get a York peppermint patty at the counter. I love a York peppermint.
[21:35.120 --> 21:42.000]  Literally every time I go to Schnucks I go to Target. I'm all about the like a single York
[22:11.360 --> 22:18.160]  you can get involved on the EDF Group text inbox, which is 314-881-TMA5. And if you're looking to
[22:18.160 --> 22:23.760]  purchase a home around the holidays or any time, I suggest Jeff Lottman. Plaz, you can hear a little
[22:23.760 --> 22:31.200]  about Jeff Lottman. Jeff Lottman made the switch to Compass St. Louis because he wanted to help
[22:31.200 --> 22:39.840]  build Compass St. Louis into the number one luxury brand in St. Louis. Compass is the largest luxury
[21:44.080 --> 21:47.920]  I don't think Jayden Daniels is playing for LSU. Yeah, no Daniels, no neighbors. I mean,
[21:47.920 --> 21:52.720]  if all these guys are playing, there's some great matchups, but they're not going to have the people
[21:52.720 --> 21:56.160]  you want to see on the field. Now, where you will see people you want to see on the field is the
[21:56.160 --> 22:00.960]  college football playoff. Doug, Alabama taking on Michigan. Alabama is getting a point and a half,
[22:00.960 --> 22:06.960]  and then Texas, Washington, Washington getting four and a half. Washington is getting four and a
[22:06.960 --> 22:12.400]  half. Yes, sir. Doug, Alabama, Michigan, are you all day Crimson Tide on that one? Yeah, because I
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.400]  peppermint patty. Enjoy that at home. And did you worry about what the what the clerk thought
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.320]  when you bought this? I did not. I did not. But I think they weren't going to ask you questions or
[21:50.320 --> 21:54.640]  start laughing or something. I didn't think an interrogation was going to come up after that.
[21:54.640 --> 21:58.720]  But you were embarrassed for the few seconds that you paid for. Ten years ago I think I would have
[21:58.720 --> 22:03.280]  been mortified. Yeah. But I walked in there like the York peppermint patty to set that up there and
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.920]  just had that you just see the hemorrhoid cream just slowly on that. You reach a certain reach
[22:07.920 --> 22:11.680]  where you really could care less what you're buying or what anyone thinks about it. Agreed.
[22:39.840 --> 22:49.600]  broker in the world. And Jeff can do that because Jeff has been selling homes in St. Louis for 22
[22:49.600 --> 22:56.000]  years. And in that time, he has sold over a half a billion dollars worth of homes. Jeff Lottman is

[22:12.400 --> 22:17.280]  want them to lose so badly. So I'm sure they'll win. I always pull for Alabama to lose. Yeah.
[22:18.080 --> 22:23.520]  So I'm sure they'll win. And I think Texas will beat Washington. Texas looks really good to me.
[22:23.520 --> 22:27.600]  They do, but Washington, every time that they've been put up against it, man, they come out
[22:27.600 --> 22:33.280]  victorious. I've doubted Washington. I really doubted them against Oregon in that Pac-12
[22:33.280 --> 22:40.560]  championship, and they played their ass off. The Pac-12 was weird this year, it was up and down,
[22:11.680 --> 22:15.840]  You ever had an after eight mint? I beg your pardon sir. It's called after eight. No.
[22:16.880 --> 22:20.800]  I dare a mint. I haven't had no long time. It's an after eight. It's kind of like a York
[22:20.800 --> 22:26.160]  peppermint patty but much better. When I worked at the Breckenridge we had those that we'd have
[22:26.160 --> 22:31.360]  a little bowl when people left after their dinner they could grab a mint. These things were so good
[22:31.360 --> 22:36.080]  man. I was I was stealing like two boxes of those a week. You stole them from the hotel? Yeah I just
[22:36.080 --> 22:40.480]  go tell the maitre d' oh we're out of mints. She'll go grab a box and I just take them.
[22:40.560 --> 22:45.280]  but it looked really good at some points. Big 12 had some sketchy moments, but then Texas has
[22:45.280 --> 22:50.560]  simply easily the best win of the year going to Tuscaloosa and beating Bama, who we just said
[22:50.560 --> 22:55.280]  we think is going to be Michigan. So I don't know. That was early in the year, though, wasn't it?
[22:55.280 --> 23:00.720]  Yeah, it was very early in the year. But I think they already pulled Milrow.
[23:02.400 --> 23:05.920]  I think Milrow played in that game. Did he? That's when they pulled him. I believe that
[23:05.120 --> 23:10.960]  it's much more about the experience than the price. They treat all their clients the same
[23:11.680 --> 23:20.240]  way. Jeff Lottman of Compass St. Louis online at J-E-F-F-L-O-T-T-M-A-N-N dot com. If you are looking

[22:41.040 --> 22:46.800]  Now are those the what are the mints that are like you can chew them they're kind of like a chalky.
[22:46.800 --> 22:50.880]  Butter mints baby. Butter mints. They have them at church a lot. I think some people have met weddings
[22:50.880 --> 22:56.240]  like as they're like colorful they're like light like light green white like you know what you're
[22:56.240 --> 23:02.480]  talking about yeah. Think in the south. God in fact eating a big of chalk. I'm a big fan actually.
[23:02.480 --> 23:05.600]  Yeah they're actually good. You don't want to bite into them you just kind of suckle. Yeah when I
[23:05.920 --> 23:10.640]  the USF game is when they pulled Milrow. That was the weird moment where it was like a teaching
[23:10.640 --> 23:16.560]  moment almost, but they almost lost to USF, who smoked Syracuse last night in the bowl game.
[23:16.560 --> 23:19.680]  Yeah, I watched it. It was like 38-0 in the fourth quarter. I was like, geez, what are we doing?
[23:20.560 --> 23:27.040]  Did you see the stat about the salary comparison of the odds on favor for the NFL MVP compared to
[23:27.040 --> 23:34.000]  Arch Manning? Yeah, I did see that. Arch Manning is a redshirt. I know he's going to probably start
[23:33.600 --> 23:41.600]  not. Is it going to be secured at home? Barn off aging. Well, I'll ride some horses probably. I might
[23:41.600 --> 23:46.800]  get the Clydesdales out, some of the quarter horses out, nearby the barn off, the stables.
[23:46.800 --> 23:51.840]  Could play some polo. Sure, sure. I don't know, croquet maybe, not off the table. Just good to
[23:51.840 --> 23:57.360]  utilize this time off to sleep, man. I'm just going to get some Z's a lot. Oh, miss out on
[23:57.360 --> 24:01.760]  sleeping when you wake up as early as we do. Well, I guess, but that's not very exciting to look
[23:05.600 --> 23:09.680]  turn it right into it I'm like oh my god it's like a cool thing of butter. I think the afterator like
[23:10.560 --> 23:15.040]  it's a mint but has a little bit of coconut in it and I think it's a Dutch chocolate.
[23:16.480 --> 23:21.440]  Oh they were good. You couldn't buy them in the store. They're just like supplied to restaurants
[23:21.440 --> 23:26.320]  and hotels. You'd have to order them. We had a store room full of them. Now we're out after
[23:26.320 --> 23:29.760]  eight mints. Here you go put them out in this red light. Why would you steal these things?
[23:30.560 --> 23:34.080]  Because you couldn't buy them anywhere. They're imported from the Netherlands? They were great
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.280]  this year. I think what you're talking about, KG, and I think they compared it to Brock Purdy.
[23:39.280 --> 23:44.800]  Correct. Who's making minimum salary? He makes 890,000 on the according to Lee Sam was 50,000.
[23:44.800 --> 23:51.680]  He makes 890,000. And with the NIL, Arch Manning made 3.1 million last year. Crazy.
[23:53.760 --> 23:58.240]  Ege, when yours are coming back, he won't start to a junior season if he stays.
[23:59.040 --> 24:02.800]  Yeah. Well, I guess he'd be redshirt soft. He'd be redshirt, so there's going to be a lot of it.
[24:01.760 --> 24:06.000]  forward to. Is it sleep? It's not necessarily. What I'm looking forward to is like Lisa Ann said,
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.480]  no alarm clock. Just get there when you want. That's the thing. You're an Olympic caliber
[24:10.480 --> 24:15.760]  sleeper. Well, I used to be, not anymore. I woke up last night about 3 a.m. and that was it.
[24:15.760 --> 24:20.320]  Really? That's all the sleep I got. Another dream about Bob Ramsey. I didn't dream about Bob Ramsey
[24:20.320 --> 24:24.000]  this time. Has he apologized yet for that? He has not. That's a big miss on his part. Still
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.880]  wandering around that golf course in Japan somewhere. No, it wasn't his fault. I don't know
[23:34.080 --> 23:39.520]  so I would just take a box. They were imported from the Netherlands eh? I don't know where they
[23:39.520 --> 23:44.080]  were imported from. Well you said they were Dutch. I said I think it was a Dutch chocolate. We didn't
[23:44.080 --> 23:49.440]  buy Dutch chocolate. That's fair. Wonderful story of Ken stealing from your employer. It's
[23:49.440 --> 23:53.920]  no surprise that you're destitute today. That's from Worsen with Wacko. Probably the most expensive
[23:53.920 --> 24:03.120]  thing I stole and I didn't really steal it but when I worked in Bermuda we had a after dinner
[24:02.800 --> 24:06.800]  He's redshirt, actually? Okay. Well, you can play four games, and then after the four-game
[24:06.800 --> 24:10.800]  cutoff, you can redshirt. I got you. Even if he did play a little this year. There might be
[24:10.800 --> 24:14.560]  more of them staying in college if they're making that kind of money. You see Caitlin Clark, the
[24:14.560 --> 24:18.720]  Iowa basketball players decided to stay in college because she makes 10 times as much
[24:18.720 --> 24:23.440]  there as she's going to make in the WNBA. Have you seen the sponsor that she has? It's like Gatorade
[24:23.440 --> 24:29.280]  at Nike. There's like a- State Farm, I think she's working with. Yeah. Like Fabletics or one of those.
[24:28.880 --> 24:32.880]  what it was. I just couldn't get back to sleep. Plowhawk, you're going to be in South St. Louis for
[24:32.880 --> 24:38.480]  the during the holiday. Traveling, which is kind of really nice, actually. So her sister and husband
[24:38.480 --> 24:44.080]  are coming in from D.C. this year. Super cool. Very much looking forward to 10 days of chilling,
[24:44.080 --> 24:49.840]  for sure. With the pups? Yeah, just hanging out, sleeping, and it's going to be super nice.
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.120]  I'll get stir crazy a little bit, but that first few days of not having to do anything is
[24:55.120 --> 24:58.400]  kind of nice. Maybe you could come in here and work on the skeleton a little bit. Fingers
[24:03.120 --> 24:10.160]  liquor cart that the Somalia would bring by and there was a we had a bottle of Louis Tre which is
[24:10.160 --> 24:20.000]  like uh $90 a shot. It comes in a $90 for one shot. Yeah it comes in a a baccarat crystal bottle
[24:20.960 --> 24:26.400]  that the bottle's probably worth a thousand and nobody ever bought this stuff. In five years I
[24:26.400 --> 24:31.040]  was there we never emptied a bottle but when I was called into the office and said we're not renewing
[24:29.280 --> 24:33.760]  Plus, it's got to be just more fun. Maybe that kind of money. She's like-
[24:33.760 --> 24:39.120]  Being in the college campus like that and playing in front of a packed house in Iowa and beyond
[24:39.120 --> 24:43.840]  national TV as opposed to the WNBA, when there'd be four people in the stands, no one watching,
[24:43.840 --> 24:50.640]  no one caring, hardly anybody can compare us. I guess 75,000 a year. Depends on who you are.
[24:50.640 --> 24:55.680]  But yeah, the money for NIL is crazy. Caitlin Clark is a great example because she's-
[24:31.040 --> 24:36.880]  your work permits you're not coming back next year. I went into the liquor cabinet and there
[24:36.880 --> 24:43.360]  was probably about there were probably about seven shots of the Louis Tre left. I dumped it out
[24:44.160 --> 24:51.600]  and I took the bottle so I took the baccarat crystal bottle home but I wasted about eight shots.
[24:51.600 --> 24:57.920]  Isn't that stealing? Yeah kind of but I wasn't coming back what do I care? Because stealing is
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.800]  Plowhawk. Someone said you should be a DJ, like taking requests, like hopping in between
[25:02.800 --> 25:07.600]  segments, just breaking it all down. Just spinning. Yeah, it would be fun. Not doing that for free,
[25:07.600 --> 25:12.080]  but certainly would be an option with a paycheck. But no, I may come in for a sound throw next week,
[25:12.080 --> 25:17.200]  depending. Other than that, you're kind of chilling. I'll tell you. We'll be doing QFTA
[25:17.200 --> 25:23.040]  during the holiday break, so you can look forward to that as the plan to do QFTA
[25:23.680 --> 25:27.760]  during the holiday break. Iggs, are you staying in town for the duration of the break?
[24:55.680 --> 25:01.520]  And she's like she's the top dog of top dogs when it comes to Iowa sports. She can't walk
[25:01.520 --> 25:05.760]  around anywhere without being the talk of the town. Yeah, is that gymnast at LSU still the number
[25:05.760 --> 25:12.160]  one NIL earner? Livia Dunn, I believe so. She's selling autographed leotards. I saw that. I did
[25:12.160 --> 25:20.480]  see that. How much is that? Not enough. Oh, yeah, the money you can make is crazy on that. But yeah,
[25:20.480 --> 25:24.320]  I mean, if you're going to make nothing in the NFL for your first year, you can stay in college
[25:28.480 --> 25:30.560]  Yeah, going anywhere.
[25:33.040 --> 25:35.280]  Hear that? Well, how will you spend your Christmas?
[25:36.720 --> 25:45.840]  My niece always has Christmas, my niece Jessica. So, yeah, it'll be fun. Ham, shrimp, presents.
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.280]  Yeah. Ham and shrimp, baby. Ham, shrimp. You got all your shopping done yet?
[25:50.240 --> 25:57.920]  Yeah, I just do it all online, Amazon. I don't have to buy a lot. I mean, we do one present,
[24:57.920 --> 25:01.520]  against the law. I was so pissed off well I really wasn't stealing I was taking an empty bottle.
[25:03.920 --> 25:08.640]  Well were they gonna reuse this thousand dollar bottle? I think you send it back in
[25:09.920 --> 25:15.200]  um but I just you still have it to this day. I was so pissed off because when I got home it was
[25:15.200 --> 25:20.240]  it had a crack in the crystal. It wasn't a crack where it was leaking but you could see the crack
[25:20.240 --> 25:27.520]  in the crystal. What I did when I moved him to my my flat down on uh Utah uh I just filled it up with
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.280]  and make a ton. I guess whatever puts you in the best situation for the future because you can't
[25:29.280 --> 25:33.200]  think short sighted on that. And NIL money is good, but it only lasts so long. Yeah, but if
[25:33.200 --> 25:36.880]  you could guarantee yourself a couple million as opposed to you go to the NFL, you don't know what's
[25:36.880 --> 25:41.360]  going to happen. You might not even make the team unless you're top draft pick. Long gone are the
[25:41.360 --> 25:45.280]  days where you get in trouble for buying somebody a chicken sandwich at the food hall. Yeah, thank
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.920]  God for real. I guess so. It's so weird how they've treated college athletes in the past.
[25:58.960 --> 26:04.720]  Secret Santa. You pick a name and you got to buy the next. My nieces and nephews.
[26:04.720 --> 26:08.000]  But aren't you worried about those packages disappearing at the apartment complex?
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.880]  No, they came and I was there. That's only meat that's being grown in real time.
[26:13.600 --> 26:17.040]  God, they stole those steaks. Those are going to be such nice steaks. Well, bowling ball was stolen.
[26:17.040 --> 26:21.600]  That was FedEx. I don't know. Amazon doesn't care anymore. They're just throw packages.
[26:22.560 --> 26:26.320]  The steaks were almost done too, weren't they? I can almost smell them from here.
[25:28.400 --> 25:35.360]  just rotgut brandy cognac. It was flexed. Then it would sit in the things that have a girl like
[25:35.920 --> 25:43.760]  a shot of Louis Tre. Oh my god look at that. It has some 6.99 bottle of brandy and they fell for it.
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.600]  I poured it into the Louis Tre bottle and they tasted and say oh that is really wonderful. They
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.360]  didn't know any better they're all Hoosiers. Oh and that bottle that he's referring to will be
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.760]  on the Hubbard lunch table tomorrow for someone to take that's from Mr. Bojane. Now that landlord
[26:27.280 --> 26:32.320]  They were going to be good. Thick, juicy. Yeah, something done. Just going to wrap and...
[26:33.920 --> 26:38.160]  You think the guy picked them up with a fork or just used his hands to pluck them right off the grill?
[26:38.160 --> 26:43.280]  I think he was spying. He saw what was going on. So he knew my routine to put them out there and
[26:43.280 --> 26:46.800]  then go in and check on something, come back out. He had a routine. So he came on a plate,
[26:47.520 --> 26:53.440]  a fork and a buddy. Because you need somebody to pick up that lid while you put the steaks on
[25:50.160 --> 25:54.960]  Yeah, it is. You signed something so that you can afford to eat that weekend and then nope,
[25:54.960 --> 25:58.560]  sorry, suspended for the rest of the year. I remember Rich Grohrer, the St. Louis U coach
[25:58.560 --> 26:05.280]  back in the late 80s, early 90s, saying they would go on some road trips and some of the kids
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.760]  couldn't afford, you know, they'd have a night out, they'd get there the day before and go to a movie
[26:09.760 --> 26:13.680]  the night before the game. Some couldn't afford $5 to get into a movie ticket. That's crazy.
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.480]  On some of these college athletes, these poor kids, their coach won't even stop for food all
[25:55.760 --> 26:00.400]  took it when he kicked me out of the apartment he kept everything I had there. He kept all your
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.480]  personal belongings and things you've stolen? Probably about 50 bowling trophies. I think
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.040]  that's where my other 300 ringers I can't find it. I think he has that. Did they realize you were
[26:09.040 --> 26:15.920]  running a fencing operation? My Louis Tre bottle. This is everything he kept. Fence it Doug. You know
[26:15.920 --> 26:22.560]  it's a fence. Doug we have a tile sponsor. We do indeed. Brown and Crouppen. They are our title
[26:53.440 --> 26:57.040]  there and then put them back down. So he probably had probably two men. And then hustle up. And you
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.200]  didn't see him in the distance walking away or see footprints or anything? Nope, didn't.
[27:01.200 --> 27:05.840]  Won't even pay any attention. Just kind of mosey. So you open the grill and the fire's still going
[27:05.840 --> 27:10.960]  and there's nothing? Nothing. Not even a little piece of fat that was laying left behind. Just
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.440]  nothing. So you start looking around to see what was going on? Yeah, I was flabbergasted. I said,
[27:16.400 --> 27:19.680]  what is... Am I losing my mind? Did I just bring him in with me when I checked the salad?
[26:22.640 --> 26:28.000]  sponsors. We are so happy that they have joined the TMA family as our title sponsors. If you have
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.680]  a potential personal injury case Brown and Crouppen is a local law firm here to serve you. The
[26:33.680 --> 26:37.600]  principals are Terry Crouppen, Andy Crouppen and Ed Herman. We've had them all in the studio.
[26:37.600 --> 26:42.560]  Wonderful guys and they would like to serve you if you need their services. They've now grown to
[26:42.560 --> 26:48.000]  become one of the largest personal injury firms in the entire Midwest. Big part of the community
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.080]  they value that. They're involved in many charities and community events. Everything from
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.280]  the way back from road games. Yeah, that happened too. Shut the program right down. Well, we had
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.960]  the money, had the credit card, I just want to stop. So what happened to the money? What happened
[26:26.960 --> 26:33.200]  to the budget? We ended up stopping. We went to actually Culver's. Only because someone
[26:33.200 --> 26:38.320]  woke up. Glad we stopped. Why are we stopping? We stopped at Culver's in Chesterfield. What?
[26:38.320 --> 26:43.600]  We're almost at the campus because these girls want a free meal. Butterburger, baby. Yeah,
[26:43.600 --> 26:48.000]  it was good for me. I had a couple of Butterburger's. Remember, Ari and Foster came out, this is right
[26:52.080 --> 26:56.560]  Annie Malone and Sister Strut to Stray Rescue. They're involved heavily in the community. Just
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.640]  built that new office there on the hill across from Ragazzi's. You got to drive by that. It used
[27:00.640 --> 27:04.800]  to be an old burned out warehouse and they've rehabbed it. It's a gorgeous place. Right down
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.400]  the road. Thank you. You may need Brown and Crouppen services. Call them. I'll give them the number now.
[27:08.400 --> 27:17.040]  314-222-2222. 314-222-2222. Or go to brownandcrouppen.com. Make sure to let them know you heard it.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.160]  after he retired from the NFL. He's still playing for the Texans about his time with Phil
[26:52.160 --> 26:59.360]  Fulmer in Tennessee. And where he called him and a group of players were hungry as hell one night
[26:59.360 --> 27:04.240]  and called up the coach and goes, yo, we have nothing to eat. We're about to do something stupid.
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.240]  Yeah. It's like third day, you're playing on Saturday, you're relying on these guys. So Phil
[27:08.240 --> 27:12.640]  Fulmer went and bought 150 taco for them dudes and dropped them off. And clearly a violation at
[27:12.640 --> 27:16.880]  the time, nothing came of it because they both were obviously out of Tennessee when a story
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.760]  Yeah. So he went back inside to check. No meat there either. No, I kind of walked up the complex
[27:25.760 --> 27:30.880]  to see if anybody happened to be like, I could see through their drapes in the living room. Maybe
[27:30.880 --> 27:34.960]  somebody just walked in with a plate of steaks. Would you have barged right in there after? Yeah,
[27:34.960 --> 27:38.000]  I would have. I would have knocked on the door and said, what the hell? Give me my steaks, man.
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.440]  Ah! I would have called a cop, get in here. They're eating my rib eyes. Unbelievable. I don't know
[27:43.440 --> 27:48.960]  if they would answer that call. Well, I put a little on my grill, on the outside of the grill,
[27:16.880 --> 27:21.760]  came out. But like, that's, that's how we treated college athletes. But if you think it was fair and
[27:21.760 --> 27:26.400]  fine that they got room and board and they their whole lives are football. They're practicing from
[27:26.400 --> 27:30.720]  in the morning, weights in the afternoon, practice in the evening with class. It's not like they can
[27:30.720 --> 27:36.000]  get a part time job. They can deserve to be paid. So I love the system now. I'm not sure the rules
[27:36.000 --> 27:42.480]  back then were meant to be punitive. They tried to, they tried to maintain the sanctity of amateurism.
[27:17.040 --> 27:22.800]  Here on TMA they'll give you that free evaluation. They work on a contingency basis. No upfront cost
[27:22.800 --> 27:26.320]  to you. If you don't get paid, they don't get paid. And they've won more than a billion dollars in
[27:26.320 --> 27:30.480]  compensation for their clients. The choice of a lawyer is an important decision and should not
[27:30.480 --> 27:35.120]  be based solely on advertising. Past results are no guarantee of future results. And every case is
[27:35.120 --> 27:41.120]  different and must be judged on its own accord. That's Brown and Crouppen, our title sponsor here
[27:41.120 --> 27:45.760]  on the morning after. I'm here to talk to you about the world's largest sports book in Las Vegas,
[27:48.960 --> 27:54.240]  I put a little eye and like a little black Sharpie, just where I would know it. Not like
[27:54.240 --> 27:59.200]  it's going to stick on and put a big, this is mine, little eye. So if it ever goes missing,
[27:59.200 --> 28:02.320]  the whole grill you're talking about. I can walk around the complex and look for
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.520]  one that looks like that and have a little eye on it so I can verify that you stole this from me.
[28:07.520 --> 28:09.680]  Well, do you have this thing chained down or something?
[28:10.560 --> 28:14.560]  No, it'd be hard to steal. I mean, you have to wheel it, pick it up and it's...
[27:45.760 --> 27:50.400]  which is now in Illinois. That's right. The circus sports app is sports betting the way it should be
[27:50.400 --> 27:56.240]  with big app bets, high betting limits, tight money line splits, and the best customer service
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.120]  around. They always got those tight money lines, better splits to more than 90% of other apps.
[28:01.120 --> 28:05.680]  And you're always dealing with real people in the customer service, not chatbot. It's always a real
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.720]  person dug last night. I was on the Rams, my last four and a half. I hate betting on the Rams. I
[27:43.200 --> 27:47.200]  And say, well, we can't pay them. What are what are the rules you're going to put into place?
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.880]  Well, you can pay them a little if we don't catch you. And yeah, the NCAA took advantage of that
[27:52.880 --> 27:57.680]  for 50 plus years. It's time for the player to take advantage of the system now. Oh, they are.
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.880]  And I love it. So yeah, that's all I love this. The problem with them getting paid. But that's,
[28:02.880 --> 28:07.600]  that's why they did it back then. It wasn't to try to punish anybody. It was just to try to,
[28:07.600 --> 28:12.080]  we have to have, we have to have some rules that we're going to maintain everybody's amateurism
[28:15.360 --> 28:19.760]  I would hear it being moved. Well, if they stole your steaks from me.
[28:21.280 --> 28:24.880]  Steaks are difficult. You lift a lid, you take a couple pieces of meat and you leave. It's kind
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.880]  of different picking up a grill and leaving with it. I don't know. I don't trust these people.
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.280]  By the way, I'm going to be on vacation next week. So if anybody, Tommy or Marty's listening,
[28:34.160 --> 28:37.280]  if anybody needs to fill in on K-Sheet, just call me. I'll fill in this time.
[28:37.920 --> 28:41.680]  It was a little offer. I had a chance when I took vacation last year to...
[28:10.720 --> 28:17.520]  almost never do it, but I liked it a lot. That covered easy money. And then coming up this
[28:17.520 --> 28:22.880]  weekend, plenty, plenty of NFL to bet on, including three of those Christmas day games.
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.360]  I don't know where I'm at on the Ravens and Niners. I'm thinking Niners, kind of like what
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.920]  the Niners are doing. I'm not sure yet, but I like that Monday Night Football game and plenty
[28:31.920 --> 28:36.240]  more with bowl games coming up. I really love Alabama getting the point and a half against
[28:36.240 --> 28:40.240]  Michigan. Like I like it almost like I'm scared a little bit. Tim and I were talking about that in
[28:12.080 --> 28:16.560]  and make it fair all over the country. You can't pay them outside of the game. You know what happens
[28:16.560 --> 28:21.280]  if they, a student athlete, we call them student athletes focuses on school more than football,
[28:21.280 --> 28:27.600]  right? Their scholarship gets revoked. Now they're paying out of pocket, like everyone else,
[28:27.600 --> 28:31.680]  don't have a scholarship. So like you have to focus on football more than education. So why is
[28:31.680 --> 28:37.280]  it have to be a student athlete? Like the coach only cares about what he's doing on the field,
[28:41.680 --> 28:45.440]  But you wouldn't come in. I do the morning show and I said, I'm on vacation. Am I going in?
[28:45.440 --> 28:48.800]  Do you still regret that? Yeah, I do. That was my chance to...
[28:49.680 --> 28:52.240]  Your moment. To host a K-Sheet show, co-host a show.
[28:53.760 --> 28:57.920]  And what did you do instead? Nothing. Didn't have to get up.
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.160]  Opportunity costs. I did. I have to get up earlier for that one because that show starts at six.
[29:02.160 --> 29:05.840]  You can't fake a lot, but you can't fake a workout. I had to probably get up at 430.
[29:06.480 --> 29:10.960]  So, yeah, I always say my vacation is not going anywhere. My vacation is that I don't have to get
[28:37.280 --> 28:41.840]  not what he's doing in the chem labs. It should be completely separate. Makes them feel better
[28:41.840 --> 28:47.840]  about their mission. Such a joke. Student athletes. Hey, pale, ILL will cover. Hop in the car with us
[28:47.840 --> 28:51.280]  and I'll have wifey go down on us both. That comes from the recovering alcoholic. Hey, you know,
[28:51.280 --> 28:56.000]  that's it. Recovery and alcoholic has been suspended to come up with those comments so close
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.760]  to the winter holiday season. He has been suspended, recovery and alcoholic, a period of two days time,
[28:40.240 --> 28:44.240]  balloon party. We can bet on all of that over there with the circa sports app, which is now
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.800]  available in Illinois. So visit circus sports.com for more details and get ready to start betting
[28:48.800 --> 28:53.280]  like a pro. If you are someone you know, maybe have a problem with gambling, call 1-800-GAMBLER
[28:53.280 --> 29:01.760]  or text ILGAMB to 833-234-DUG. Speaking of Los Angeles, the Dodgers got another one.
[29:02.720 --> 29:09.680]  They sure did. No, she no boo. Yamamoto and the Los Angeles Dodgers are in agreement on a 12 year
[29:10.960 --> 29:15.360]  up at 530. That's my vacation. Nothing wrong with that. Doug, The Ringer has released their
[29:15.360 --> 29:22.080]  top five shows of 2023. The Ringers? The Ringer. That's a website. Yeah, Bill Simmons
[29:22.080 --> 29:26.320]  owns... He took his grant on the website and started his own thing. It's called The Ringer.
[29:27.440 --> 29:32.640]  They released their top five shows. Have you ever seen a murderer at the end of the world?
[29:33.600 --> 29:37.440]  No. And when you say shows, you mean TV shows on network TV or
[29:09.760 --> 29:17.280]  325 million dollar contract ending his frenzy of a free agency with the largest deal for a
[29:17.280 --> 29:21.920]  pitcher in years and value in Major League Baseball history. None of it deferred too. He wants his
[29:21.920 --> 29:27.520]  money. He wants his money. He has an order. Supposedly he's the best, possibly the best pitcher in
[29:27.520 --> 29:31.920]  Japanese baseball history. Have you seen some of his numbers? It's insane. They're sick. They got
[29:31.920 --> 29:37.840]  up for less than 20,000 or 20 million a year, didn't they? 27 million a year. He's only 25 years
[29:01.760 --> 29:07.440]  and he's been fined. Oh, he's been fined $100. Yeah, just like Southwest. Yeah, covering
[29:07.440 --> 29:11.840]  alcoholic of Belleville, suspended, a period of two days time. His name right now is going
[29:11.840 --> 29:18.000]  to the suspension law, and he has indeed been fined a total of $100 for his comments. He's such a nice
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.480]  guy. I'll probably pay it. Yeah. And that really stands before the Christmas holiday like that.
[29:22.480 --> 29:26.240]  Yeah. On top of all the credit card bills that are going to come in. Yeah, I can't imagine that
[29:26.240 --> 29:30.720]  feels very good. No, it doesn't feel good. Yeah. Illinois is a six and a half point favorite tonight
[29:38.240 --> 29:41.360]  streamers anywhere? I think that's a Netflix show. I keep seeing
[29:42.160 --> 29:47.360]  FX. So I assume Hulu has got that. Yeah, Hulu. I've seen it. I haven't seen the promos when I
[29:47.360 --> 29:51.920]  go to Hulu and it shows the stuff you could see. I haven't watched it. Okay. So none of us are on
[29:51.920 --> 30:01.840]  that one. Number four is Silo. Silo, Apple TV. It's a sci-fi phonetics dream. Alt history.
[29:37.840 --> 29:44.160]  old. He's won the equivalent of their MVP in Cy Young three years in a row. Over the last 820
[29:44.160 --> 29:52.640]  and a third innings, which is what, four seasons plus, his ERA is 1.65. Struck out five times as
[29:52.640 --> 30:00.640]  many as he walks. Gives up about a home run every three games. And he's all of 5'10", 176 pounds.
[30:01.280 --> 30:06.880]  They say he doesn't lift weights. He has a unique training method that prioritizes flexibility and
[29:30.720 --> 29:35.360]  against Missouri here in St. Louis, the 13th ranked Illinois Fighting Illini. What's your
[29:35.360 --> 29:40.080]  confidence level that you'll return the favor from last year in Missouri, put the beat down on ILL
[29:40.080 --> 29:46.400]  and daddy, Brad the Underwood. I think I'm 85% confident. I think Mizzou cannot play very good
[29:46.400 --> 29:52.480]  defense, which I think is, I think the size factor as well for Illinois. I think we have
[29:52.480 --> 29:56.880]  Ty Rogers who's six, five, who's a point guard sometimes. You have, you know, Shannon on the
[30:02.400 --> 30:06.720]  What am I seeing here? It's a great sci-fi program. Mystery box storytelling.
[30:07.840 --> 30:12.480]  Nuclear rockets held in silos. I've actually heard silos. That's how they do it sometimes.
[30:12.480 --> 30:18.640]  It's quite good. So I have yet to see it. Next. Number three. This is one I believe some of us.
[30:18.640 --> 30:25.360]  Do we have initials, please? Sure. T.B. Bear. Tom Bear. K.G. Nailed it. Who was it? The Bear.
[30:25.360 --> 30:30.080]  Oh, yeah. The Bear with Jeremy Allen White. But Jack Nicklaus. Jack Nicklaus, live story.
[30:06.880 --> 30:11.680]  movement over raw strength. Doesn't lift, relying instead on a regimen of bodyweight exercises,
[30:11.680 --> 30:18.320]  stretches, and a significant amount of throwing from tiny soccer balls to many javelins to long
[30:18.320 --> 30:23.920]  toss and bullpens with regulation-sized baseballs. His athleticism, they say, allows him to impart
[30:23.920 --> 30:31.280]  force on the ball, disproportionate to his size. I mean, it's Otani Yamamoto and Glassnow.
[30:30.080 --> 30:36.640]  Too much anxiety-ridden scenes. The Christmas episode is crazy. It was really good first season
[30:36.640 --> 30:40.960]  I thought the second season took a huge step. Really? I loved the second season. I thought it
[30:40.960 --> 30:46.160]  went just chaotic. I thought the first season kind of had... The chaos didn't really appeal to me.
[30:46.160 --> 30:50.320]  Yeah, some people... But the Christmas episode of that is the famous one, which is extremely
[30:50.320 --> 30:55.200]  anxiety-ridden, but also full of sick guest stars. You ever seen The Bear Eggs? No. You would love it.
[29:56.880 --> 30:01.440]  swing, Hawkins can play low or high, Goodie who's six, six. You still have Andy Kaufman,
[30:02.400 --> 30:07.440]  the man on the moon. Yeah. You know, I'm a club, but I think Illinois, you know, Missouri has a
[30:07.440 --> 30:12.640]  sky of seven foot five. I do know, but it doesn't look that, I can't believe you wear number 75,
[30:12.640 --> 30:16.720]  right? It's the first year that, so they changed. I didn't know that was possible. No, it wasn't up
[30:16.720 --> 30:20.800]  until this year, obviously, or not obviously I say this because I've told people this and they're like
[30:20.800 --> 30:25.440]  shocked, but back before this year, you could only wear digits of five. Well, you have to be,
[30:31.280 --> 30:36.640]  Is there rotation? No top trade? That's insane. Well, guys like that, if he's come up with the
[30:37.440 --> 30:42.560]  way on how to train as a pitcher, he could revolutionize the way pitching is taught.
[30:42.560 --> 30:47.040]  We're doing something wrong now. When virtually every starting pitcher needs Tommy John surgery
[30:47.040 --> 30:50.720]  at some point. We're doing something wrong. Who else they got in their rotation? Walker Bueller.
[30:50.720 --> 30:55.280]  Dustin May. wait, Kershaw. Tony Gonslin. Oh, Kershaw is done for the year. Don Drysdale.
[30:55.200 --> 31:01.120]  I started watching it for like five minutes and I said, he's standing in a hallway staring at a bear.
[31:02.240 --> 31:06.960]  What has this done? You would absolutely love it. I'm being dead serious. About a restaurant, right?
[31:06.960 --> 31:10.880]  Yes. It's about a guy running a restaurant. You would love it. Jeremy Allen White, who of course...
[31:10.880 --> 31:16.480]  Yeah, I like him. Shameless. He's also in a new movie called The Iron Claw about the... About Fritz von
[31:16.480 --> 31:21.280]  Eric. Who was that guy from? The wrestler from the... Oh, it is about Fritz von Eric. Yes, it is about the
[30:56.160 --> 31:03.280]  Stankofax. They're loaded. Don, did they trade for Glassnow? Yeah. That's what I'm saying. So that
[31:03.280 --> 31:07.920]  Glassnow is the third. So now we have a team to root against all year. Well, they paid actually,
[31:08.800 --> 31:14.480]  they spent a billion dollars on pitching. I mean, Otani is also, I mean, he thought to pitch this
[31:14.480 --> 31:20.160]  year. Obviously. I think Arnold's start the season against them, don't they? Yep. I think,
[30:25.440 --> 30:30.160]  because it looks like 25, right? You could wear one through five, you could wear 10 through 15,
[30:30.160 --> 30:34.240]  you could wear up until 55 was the highest you could be, but they've changed that now. As you see,
[30:34.240 --> 30:39.600]  Connor Vanover wears 75, Bronnie James wears number six to honor his father. Correct. So they've
[30:39.600 --> 30:43.840]  changed that rule, but yes, you wear 75 because he is seven foot five. I saw that and it blew my
[30:43.840 --> 30:49.760]  mind. I've never seen a number 75 back row uniform. That was actually the first time I've ever seen it.
[30:49.760 --> 30:53.520]  NBA, you could do it all the time. But it's a rhyme. You could wear your weight. You could be
[31:21.280 --> 31:25.680]  whole family and that whole... The wrestling family. Apparently, it's outstanding. So I'm
[31:25.680 --> 31:30.640]  definitely gonna be seeing that in theaters coming up. But yeah, The Bear Fish is number two. I've
[31:30.640 --> 31:35.440]  heard a lot about this one, but I've yet to see it. Reservation dogs? Any of you boys seen reservation
[31:35.440 --> 31:41.600]  dogs? No. I'd like you to be my one, I think. I think so. Reservoir dog I've seen. Right. Reservoir dogs,
[31:41.600 --> 31:45.600]  but yeah, I have not seen reservation dogs. And then number one, I think we can all guess this one.
[30:53.520 --> 31:01.600]  number 115. I was double zero when I was little. Oh, you were double zero? Because at the time,
[31:03.600 --> 31:09.120]  and I think Eric Montreux, a couple of them had the double zero. Then I was like, oh, this is sick.
[31:09.760 --> 31:15.840]  That's a good call. But also- You're 85% confident. Yeah, it's a rivalry at a neutral site. I mean,
[31:15.840 --> 31:20.640]  we were the better team last year and got slapped. Slapped by 25. So I don't know,
[31:20.160 --> 31:26.320]  how much money are the Dodgers making that they can throw out all this? I mean, the, as you know,
[31:26.320 --> 31:31.280]  Doug, the LA sports scene isn't as robust, but the Dodgers and Lakers always do well.
[31:31.280 --> 31:34.960]  They'd have to be making 10 times what the Cardinals are making. And maybe they are.
[31:34.960 --> 31:37.440]  Where's Larry King for pay for those tickets down there, Mary Hart?
[31:38.560 --> 31:40.560]  Larry King. Larry King's no matter what.
[31:40.560 --> 31:44.080]  I know, but when he, him and he always said next to Mary Hart, what do they pay for those tickets
[31:44.080 --> 31:48.560]  down there? Probably a ton. I don't know. Quarter of a million. What does Jack pay for his court sides?
[31:46.400 --> 31:49.440]  What are the initials? S. S. Superman. No.
[31:51.440 --> 31:59.200]  Shameless. No. Silence. Sopranos. No. Succession. Bingo. Succession. Succession finishes number one
[32:00.160 --> 32:04.960]  on the... Is that Yellowstone in there? It's hard to believe. Actually, they're top 10. I just saved
[32:04.960 --> 32:10.560]  people some time, but I did not see Yellowstone not in there. Well. Yeah, they ruined that show by just
[31:20.640 --> 31:25.520]  I'm very confident last year. I like a little bit more better than leadership this year. So I think
[31:26.640 --> 31:31.680]  a 10.8 point, I don't know if Mizzou covers. I just don't know if Mizzou will cover the six.
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.400]  Are you guys going to the game? I couldn't get, I really wanted to take Madison's father,
[31:36.400 --> 31:42.880]  but I just couldn't secure two tickets. I will be there. I'll be watching from home.
[31:44.320 --> 31:48.480]  Maybe, but I would have loved to gone this year. I think it's going to be a really good game.
[31:48.560 --> 31:53.280]  What is their? Probably a thousand, a thousand a ticket per game, you think? Ballpark? Yeah.
[31:53.280 --> 31:58.800]  Probably get some deal. What is there? I mean, I'm sure they're going to have a great TV deal.
[31:58.800 --> 32:04.320]  Oh, yeah. Because you think about that payroll. I mean, just think about it. You're paying a guy,
[32:04.320 --> 32:08.400]  you know, you're starting rotation, a hundred something million dollars a year just for your
[32:08.400 --> 32:14.000]  rotation. How do you possibly make that much money on a baseball team? It said in 2022,
[32:10.560 --> 32:17.360]  not making it very accessible. The dentist thing? I think they just... To me, I love this show to
[32:17.360 --> 32:22.400]  death, but then I didn't... They didn't do a lot of publicity on when it started. And it used to be on
[32:22.400 --> 32:29.040]  YouTube TV to rewatch episodes. Now it isn't. Now, like, you have to have Paramount. With that great
[32:29.040 --> 32:33.680]  of a show and that good of a cast, it's basically hiding. Well, I think they were in the end now,
[32:33.680 --> 32:40.000]  too, because when it does start, there's no Kevin Costner. So... All right. Well, I haven't seen any of
[32:14.000 --> 32:23.600]  the Dodgers had a revenue of 581 million. Which will be now triple that with two global Japanese
[32:23.600 --> 32:31.200]  superstars. That's how you get money is you have every Japanese kid wearing a Yamamoto and Otani
[32:31.200 --> 32:36.320]  Jersey rocking a Dodgers cap. But wouldn't all of them, they'd like to split in that merchandising?
[32:37.120 --> 32:42.640]  I don't know. I don't know how that works. I'm just saying, get getting them to become
[31:48.560 --> 31:52.640]  I will be there. It's my favorite night of the year. Really? Right around the holiday too. It's
[31:52.640 --> 31:58.080]  Friday. This is all active for 10 days. That's why it's the, we're off for a week. Right around
[31:58.080 --> 32:03.600]  the holidays, there's always a good atmosphere in there. It's 50-50 split up and people are fired
[32:03.600 --> 32:07.760]  up for it, but it's not like, there's not like bad blood by any means. It's just a good old-fashioned
[32:07.760 --> 32:12.880]  rivalry between two bordering states. Yeah, they're bordering. You're going to do the club scene
[32:40.080 --> 32:44.240]  those. Well, the Duttons won every scenario. There was no scenario where they didn't somehow come out
[32:44.240 --> 32:48.640]  more actively and win it and get the upper hand. That's what annoyed me. Not one family had that...
[32:48.640 --> 32:54.000]  I mean, just... God. They never lost. They never lost any argument, any dispute. Clearly, nobody went
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.600]  to jail. It just... You knew they were gonna come out smelling like roses in a show like that. Just
[32:59.600 --> 33:05.440]  annoys them. And you weren't gonna have it. It's just... Oh, my God. They can do nothing wrong. It's just so annoying.
[32:42.720 --> 32:48.640]  Dodger fans. Growing that globally is probably how they're going to make their money. They're
[32:48.640 --> 32:53.440]  ambassadors of the game now. They're there for 20, 12 years. They might be able to sell their
[32:53.440 --> 32:59.120]  team TV rights to Japan, make some money that way. We got your two biggest stars playing for us.
[32:59.760 --> 33:06.640]  You want to pump all our games to Tokyo? Three billion for 10 years. I know Otani was at the
[33:06.640 --> 33:11.840]  Rams game last night. He was. He knew nothing about what was going on. No, he'd for him. So
[32:12.880 --> 32:17.840]  afterwards? I don't know on that. I don't know on that. We'll see. Show off your hair and everything.
[32:17.840 --> 32:22.320]  I don't know. You got to milk Mugele and Biggies afterwards. Have a cocktail. Where?
[32:22.320 --> 32:25.040]  Stand Mugele and Biggies. It shut down in the 60s.
[32:26.800 --> 32:30.320]  It sounds like a point that would have shut down in the 60s. That's where the science center is now.
[32:31.120 --> 32:36.000]  Okay. Very popular place way back then. Nice little hangout after the game. Oh wow, look at this.
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.200]  Biggie was not wrong. The recovering alcoholic just sent a screenshot of a hundred dollar
[33:05.920 --> 33:08.960]  I'll tell you what I'm rewatching, and it brings me back to...
[33:11.200 --> 33:19.680]  If you were wealthy back in, let's say, the late 15th, early 16th century,
[33:21.520 --> 33:26.720]  you had it made in England because you were invited to court.
[33:28.240 --> 33:33.840]  And I don't think they still have a court with Prince Charles in them. But basically,
[33:11.920 --> 33:19.360]  considering buying the team for a best. I don't know if I don't know if it was correct or somebody
[33:19.360 --> 33:26.000]  photoshopped something, but I thought I saw where before. So let's go with it. I think we should go.
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.680]  It didn't make a lot of, you know, maybe it is. It's Los Angeles, so it could be.
[33:29.680 --> 33:37.200]  But I think it says something. The average ticket price at Chez Ravine last year was like $820.
[32:41.200 --> 32:45.520]  contribution to the Meghan Meyer Foundation due to his fine and suspension. How about that?
[32:46.240 --> 32:52.000]  He's one of the better people ever. Now you don't have to do that. This new finding system is really
[32:52.000 --> 32:56.560]  paying dividends. Yeah, it's actually a... Doug's going to need a Wes Beak though. Yeah, I figured
[32:56.560 --> 33:02.560]  you just pay Doug. When we go private, we'll have Doug's Venmo on the curtain. Yeah, start finding
[33:02.560 --> 33:08.800]  people. Yeah, I think I will. Funnel that cash into our pocket, Doug. I love this. Thank you,
[33:33.840 --> 33:39.680]  what the court was is if you were invited to court by the king, and in this case, Henry VIII,
[33:40.960 --> 33:47.920]  you got a room in the castle, and you didn't have to do anything. You get up in the morning,
[33:47.920 --> 33:53.680]  you go out, they have lush gardens all over the ground, so you could play croquet.
[33:54.640 --> 33:58.160]  You could go horseback riding. You could sit in the garden and have wine and relax.
[33:37.200 --> 33:42.320]  No way. And the average ticket price. Average. And after these two signings, the average price
[33:42.320 --> 33:47.520]  are going to raise it to like $1,400 average per ticket. The only way that would be possible is
[33:47.520 --> 33:53.440]  if the top tickets were like an insane amount. Insane amount. Yeah. I bet the median number is
[33:53.440 --> 33:57.280]  way lower than that. You know, the bottom tickets that we said were $1,000 a game or maybe, you know,
[33:57.280 --> 34:03.360]  $3,000 a game. And that's, you know, $200,000. Who's paying $240,000 a year for season tickets?
[33:08.880 --> 33:13.280]  Christopher. He is fantastic. Underwood don't care about this game, Plow. That's from the
[33:13.280 --> 33:18.880]  bastard James Hodd. Take Mizzou plus six and a half. I don't know if there's a lack of care.
[33:19.600 --> 33:24.560]  I think Underwood is much more, I agree, focused on Big Ten play. He doesn't really love
[33:26.000 --> 33:31.840]  the tournaments at the beginning either. We play in them, but you could tell that he'd much rather
[33:32.400 --> 33:36.240]  care. Why would they care? Every time you run out of the field or him walk out of the field,
[33:59.120 --> 34:03.600]  Maybe take a nap. And then at night, nothing but drinking and eating.
[34:04.560 --> 34:07.840]  You can do that just about anywhere, can't you? Just sit around, relax, eat, and drink?
[34:08.480 --> 34:12.080]  You don't pay anything. Of course, they're rich anyway. But all the
[34:12.960 --> 34:19.920]  who's who's of English society, right? Court with the king. And you sit and you're eating boar and elk and
[34:20.400 --> 34:22.560]  whatever kind of food they had and wine.
[34:03.360 --> 34:10.160]  Average is $171 per ticket last year. It's expected to increase to $295. Yeah. $300 next year.
[34:10.160 --> 34:14.720]  That was a little off, but. The average ticket at Dodger Stadium, $295. That's pretty wild. That's
[34:14.720 --> 34:21.280]  a really insane. How do 50,000 people afford to pay that every night? They don't have a $5
[34:21.280 --> 34:25.920]  ticket then, obviously. I mean, it's one thing to sell to the super rich down below. That's
[34:25.920 --> 34:31.200]  never a problem. But you're not talking about 50,000 tickets there. There's people out there in the
[33:36.240 --> 33:40.000]  you care. Of course. You won't. You'd be dead if you didn't care. That's what I'm saying. I think
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.000]  he cares. I know he really loves Big Ten play. That's when he really gets riled up, which will
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.880]  happen. I do believe Big Ten play starts after... I think we play for... Fairley Dickinson. We play
[33:52.880 --> 33:57.120]  Fairley Dickinson after... They are not the Big Ten. We play them after Mizzou. Almost everyone else
[33:57.120 --> 34:01.280]  isn't a Big Ten, but they are not. You remember Fairley Dickinson, Plowhawk from last year. I do.
[34:23.440 --> 34:28.080]  Probably some tripe. And then if you're a single guy, you're invited to court. I mean, you're
[34:28.080 --> 34:33.680]  banging them two at a time. Because the women are just looking for a rich nobleman to marry.
[34:33.680 --> 34:37.600]  So you got your pick of the litter. Then you go to bed, get up and do it all. That's all you do
[34:38.560 --> 34:42.400]  at court. It's nothing. Well, now this is what they did in the TV show, you mean?
[34:42.400 --> 34:45.520]  Well, that's, you know, if that's based in reality, they didn't make this up.
[34:46.320 --> 34:50.800]  Well, they make up a lot of stuff for TV shows. Well, Henry VIII is pretty right on the entire
[34:31.440 --> 34:36.960]  far reaches of the bleachers. And so what are they paying for a ticket? $100, $150 for a bleacher
[34:36.960 --> 34:41.040]  ticket? What the Dodgers are doing reminds me a lot of like college football to where it's such
[34:41.040 --> 34:45.760]  a cluster, but I kind of am enjoying it because eventually it's going to change. Like eventually
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.720]  you get one team that does this with a half a billion and deferred money. They spend a billion
[34:50.720 --> 34:58.480]  on just their rotation in one year. Eventually this is going to change some sort about baseball.
[34:01.280 --> 34:06.640]  Number one seed per due in the first round of the NCAA tournament. FDU, go Dicks. Purdue's going to
[34:06.640 --> 34:12.880]  be ranked number one now that they beat Arizona. Yeah. Oh yeah. I hate that the Big Ten is really
[34:12.880 --> 34:18.160]  down, as opposed to what it was pre-season rankings. Well, not if you get the number one team.
[34:18.160 --> 34:22.800]  Purdue is kind of... Michigan State's kind of a nobody team now. They always heat up towards March.
[34:22.800 --> 34:28.560]  Oh, they do. Tommy is the one. I'm ready to go. Calipari. I don't know what gives us fits, but...
[34:50.800 --> 34:57.440]  four seasons. But I mean, they did do that. They had a court. And that's what you did at the court.
[34:57.440 --> 35:03.360]  If you're if you got kicked out of the court, you were you were crestfallen. If the king said,
[35:03.360 --> 35:08.320]  maybe it was your ancestors, you're no longer welcome a court. And you could you could you
[35:08.320 --> 35:12.400]  couldn't do that nowadays. You just walk up to Prince Charles or Queen Elizabeth the court.
[35:12.400 --> 35:17.840]  Hey, babe. Glass of wine. Hey, how you doing? If you're in court, you can just walk up to the king
[34:58.480 --> 35:02.240]  I mean, I know they're never going to agree on a salary cap, but you cannot possibly defer
[35:03.040 --> 35:09.520]  98% of a contract. You need to stop all that. Yeah. So this is kind of fun to watch college
[35:09.520 --> 35:14.560]  football need to completely change how the NIL works and transfer, but watching it is fun.
[35:15.760 --> 35:19.600]  I think we talked about it the other day where their payroll for 2040, they're already up to 80
[35:19.600 --> 35:24.000]  million. They all in the year 2040 on payroll. Like that, that to me should never happen. And
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.520]  He's no stroke coach on that team. Oh yeah, which is surprising to me too. I cannot believe he...
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.520]  Why? He looks exactly the same. He hadn't aged at all. I remember him with
[34:37.520 --> 34:42.160]  Richardson and what is it, Matin Cleves? Magic Johnson. No, that was Judd Heathcote. Oh, I love
[34:42.160 --> 34:48.960]  Matin Cleves when he was in college. He's 68. No, God, he got 10 more years. Beihon was like, what,
[34:48.960 --> 34:54.080]  80? He was up there. He looked 90. He got to the point where he wet his pants on one game. You see
[35:17.840 --> 35:22.240]  and have a conversation and dance if you wanted to. Don't you think those even King Charles,
[35:22.240 --> 35:27.840]  don't you think he has casual friends who say, hey, Chuck? No, no, no, no. You lived your whole
[35:27.840 --> 35:34.000]  life kind of in this weird bubble of being a modern world. But I bet the people that married into it,
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.560]  I bet they still had their friends. Oh, yeah. 100 if you married. I don't know. Back in the old days,
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.760]  I mean, they you'd behead your brother or sister if they didn't obey you.
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.440]  again, like that'll probably change, but can't the owner after 10 or 12 years, let's say the
[35:29.440 --> 35:33.120]  Yamamoto contract is over your two years into deferred or tiny money and you're going to go,
[35:33.120 --> 35:37.680]  I want to sell the team. Yeah. I mean, you're probably selling it for 6 billion. And then the
[35:38.240 --> 35:42.400]  other owner is responsible for all the rest of the deferred money. That could happen. I don't
[35:42.400 --> 35:46.560]  know who owned the Dodgers, but that's what I would do. I don't want to be a part of the negotiation group.
[35:46.560 --> 35:50.160]  I don't want to be a part of a half a billion dollar paying for a 45 year old pitcher.
[34:54.800 --> 34:59.920]  that? Yeah, he's currently 79. He's currently 79. You're not kink shaming, are you? No, but you get to
[34:59.920 --> 35:03.760]  that age and you got to go to the restroom often and if you're in the middle of a basketball game,
[35:04.320 --> 35:08.000]  you probably couldn't just excuse himself real quick. You think you can hold up a little drill,
[35:08.000 --> 35:14.800]  it comes out. Yeah. Coach Dipe. Probably. Yeah, maybe that's a new brand. That's not a bad idea at all.
[35:14.800 --> 35:20.160]  It's better than pooping. My sources are telling me that Gangster Pete booked an entire section
[35:44.320 --> 35:50.800]  Yeah. Nowadays, I think it's probably probably, you know, they called. Hey, Lizzie.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.680]  Back when she was alive. Jackson just called the year we can't take any more of this from the
[35:55.680 --> 35:59.840]  hunchback of on Castle. Isn't this Iggy's life now? He just doesn't do anything. That's from
[35:59.840 --> 36:03.600]  Terry Chibaka. But I'm not eating boar and drinking nice wine and playing croquet.
[36:05.120 --> 36:08.320]  I don't know if I walk in and go, yeah, give me that slab of bore me.
[35:50.160 --> 35:55.520]  I think the days of a single person ownership in sports are quickly coming to an end.
[35:55.520 --> 35:58.960]  Unless it's Bezos or Elon Musk or one of these guys, they got it.
[35:58.960 --> 36:02.880]  Yeah, they got it. But like the DeWitt families are few and far between.
[36:02.880 --> 36:08.560]  But Steve Cohen, with the Mets, he's supposedly the richest. He's worth like 15 or 20 billion.
[36:08.560 --> 36:11.360]  You always have the Coens, the Dolans, the Cronkys, but...
[36:11.360 --> 36:13.040]  That's who owns the teams.
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.400]  Yeah, that's who owns the big, big coastal teams. But I'm talking like even like Midwest team are
[36:08.320 --> 36:14.000]  Tried to have a steak, but someone stole it. Tried my stuffed pigeon. My chef does it the best.
[36:15.760 --> 36:19.200]  Boar. If boar was so good, how can we don't eat it now?
[36:20.640 --> 36:26.320]  I guess maybe we do eat. Boars had turkey. You're eating pig, aren't you? Yeah. That's the same
[36:26.320 --> 36:31.680]  thing. Why do you keep saying boar? I think it's just another name for a pig. Wild boar.
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.080]  You don't manufacture those. You don't you get to kill those in the wild. Yeah.
[35:20.240 --> 35:24.080]  for bragging rights game with his Extreme Kick the Can Intermural team that comes from
[35:24.080 --> 35:27.760]  glove blogger Tom Traven. I'm sure Gangster Pete will be there. I hope Gangster Pete will be there.
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.000]  Oh, that probably should be Pat. I think it's sold out, right? I don't know. No. It isn't sold out.
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.760]  The weather, the holiday. You can get tickets. I'm not saying. I don't know. I've been looking
[35:37.760 --> 35:41.120]  because I'm going to purchase them after the presentation today because I'm waiting to get
[35:41.120 --> 35:45.280]  to write at the right spot for me. I'm looking around. It's the fees that are the problems. So
[35:45.280 --> 35:49.680]  if someone has tickets that they want to sell so I can avoid Ticketmaster fees, I'd be happy to pay
[36:18.400 --> 36:21.840]  starting to get picked up by groups as opposed to single people ownership.
[36:21.840 --> 36:27.840]  And backing up with Iggy was kind of correct. Ben and Wildwood did send a text. It's a screenshot.
[36:27.840 --> 36:29.920]  This is for the opening day tickets.
[36:29.920 --> 36:30.960]  Is that what I saw? Okay.
[36:30.960 --> 36:37.200]  Yeah, 580 for opening day. Last year, the average $1,236 for opening day this year.
[36:37.200 --> 36:40.320]  Okay, so the stats were correct. It just wasn't seasonal.
[36:40.960 --> 36:42.800]  The Dodgers don't have a ton of giveaways either.
[36:37.040 --> 36:40.960]  Anyway, I just find it fascinating back in the day that you really had to do nothing. Just go to
[36:40.960 --> 36:45.280]  court and you were ahead of maid. I think life was so tough back then. I don't think you'd want
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.320]  anything to do with it. Oh yeah. I mean, if you had a cut, you're probably dead in a day.
[36:49.360 --> 36:53.600]  So a lot of people are texting in your brother's sister. Isn't that just your sister? That's
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.240]  from both from Maxwell Hung and Chuck Talent. What's that? I think they're in reference to
[36:58.240 --> 37:05.360]  you saying beheading your brother's sister. I think you meant brother or sister. Oh my god.
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.000]  I don't think any does any team have as many I know we can find this out.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.520]  But do the Cardinals lead the league in most giveaways?
[36:51.520 --> 36:52.000]  They might.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.920]  They have 40. If you check their giveaway kind of roughly like 30.
[36:55.920 --> 36:58.160]  They do a fantastic job of marketing the team.
[36:58.160 --> 36:58.960]  Wonderful, wonderful.
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.600]  They get sponsors to pay for the stuff and they get fans to show up by the tens of thousands
[37:03.600 --> 37:04.320]  to come and get it.
[37:04.320 --> 37:07.280]  Look at the giveaways that Dodgers had. LeBron James bobblehead.
[37:08.960 --> 37:10.160]  Fernando Valenzuela.
[37:11.040 --> 37:12.240]  Fernando Valenzuela.
[35:49.680 --> 35:54.560]  you. I'll go one up. Anybody got two extra ducats for free? Oh, I would like to. I will pay.
[35:55.520 --> 35:58.880]  But if not, I'm just going to buy one. Jackson, are you willing to sit up top or are you trying
[35:58.880 --> 36:03.280]  to sit down low? Either or. I don't really care. I just want to get in the building, but I will
[36:03.280 --> 36:07.680]  be paying for the tickets. Don't worry. I'm just going to credential. I might have something you're
[36:07.680 --> 36:11.440]  interested in. All right. Shoot me a text, baby. Isn't the government trying to come up with a way
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.520]  to get rid of some of those fees? I don't know, man. It bangs you. It's not going to pass a law to
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.720]  Here we go again. I saw it on TV and it's historical facts. Roman had sex slave boy,
[37:10.720 --> 37:15.120]  Charles, finishing off emperors, English course, banged him two at a time, and Winston Churchill
[37:15.120 --> 37:19.200]  was a war criminal. Come on, dude. That's from Worson Woods Wacko. Why don't you just go Google
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.920]  Henry the Ace Court and see if any of it's correct. They didn't make up having a court.
[37:25.920 --> 37:29.600]  Oh, I wouldn't think so. Let's give him a court where all these people show up and live in the
[37:29.600 --> 37:35.120]  castle. Let's just make this up. No, there was such thing as the court. Why did he bother to have
[37:12.240 --> 37:13.680]  Caleb Williams bobblehead night.
[37:14.560 --> 37:15.440]  Book our flight now.
[37:15.440 --> 37:18.560]  Replica Tommy Lasorda 1988 World Series ring.
[37:19.520 --> 37:21.520]  Oral Hershcizer bobblehead.
[37:21.520 --> 37:23.040]  That's pretty much all the bobbleheads I see.
[37:24.480 --> 37:27.600]  Plazzy, what is Busch Stadium the house that bobbleheads built?
[37:27.600 --> 37:29.440]  I did mention that one time.
[37:29.440 --> 37:32.480]  I don't know if it was received well by the fan base.
[37:32.480 --> 37:37.520]  It can't be good for the game overall to have one team spending all this money.
[37:37.520 --> 37:38.240]  Again.
[36:15.520 --> 36:20.480]  get rid of some of the stupid fees. Can you imagine a better business model? I'm saying.
[36:20.480 --> 36:24.640]  Ticketmaster where you don't have any product except the software. That's what I'm saying.
[36:24.640 --> 36:27.760]  All you got to do is keep the app running. And you charge outrageous fees for every one of the tens
[36:27.760 --> 36:31.760]  of thousands of tickets you sell every single night. And there's really no, like I know there's
[36:31.760 --> 36:36.720]  employees there, but talk about like when they buy the ticket or when you know you, me or whatever,
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.960]  it's an immediate bounce back email. Not one person is sending that email for your tickets.
[37:35.200 --> 37:40.560]  that? He just wanted friends, circle of friends? I guess, you know, and it was a status thing, you
[37:40.560 --> 37:48.000]  know, to people that weren't lords and sirs and knights, you know. What show was this?
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.840]  The Tudors. I don't want to rain on any parades, but I'm seeing that it was notorious for taking
[37:53.840 --> 37:59.200]  a lot of liberties with historical fact. Yeah, but which ones? Having a court wasn't one of them.
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.400]  It's like all algorithm to keep that app and your software running. And that's the whole
[36:46.400 --> 36:53.280]  billion dollar plan. That's unreal. Robert Smith of the cure did his best to get rid of the fees.
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.320]  First of all, they kept the ticket prices down where I was fortunate to get section 102, I think,
[36:58.320 --> 37:05.920]  for a hundred dollars. And people started complaining about the fees. And Robert Smith
[37:38.240 --> 37:43.600]  And nearly every other team in the league hopelessly out of the running to sign any of these players.
[37:43.600 --> 37:45.600]  I can't wait till they lose a five game series.
[37:45.600 --> 37:46.960]  It will be funny.
[37:46.960 --> 37:53.040]  In 2040, the Dodgers already have almost double the payroll of the A's on the Pirates.
[37:53.040 --> 37:56.640]  This is in 2040 to today's.
[37:57.280 --> 37:58.320]  Like that's insane.
[37:58.880 --> 37:59.760]  I agree with you Doug.
[37:59.760 --> 38:02.000]  But at the same time, even if you put a cap on it,
[38:02.560 --> 38:05.040]  the teams that don't spend money still aren't going to spend money.
[38:05.040 --> 38:06.320]  If they don't have it, they won't.
[37:59.200 --> 38:09.280]  But I mean, each season had historical facts of, you know, Queen Catherine, who he married because
[38:09.280 --> 38:15.120]  it was his brother's wife, and married because he said, or she said that the marriage wasn't
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.160]  consummated so he could marry her. And because he wanted to dump her and go with Anne Boleyn,
[38:20.160 --> 38:25.280]  he came up with an excuse saying she did have sex so I can annul the marriage and didn't annul
[37:05.920 --> 37:11.760]  took Ticketmaster to task and said, this is stupid. You're charging all these fees just for
[37:11.760 --> 37:16.880]  the ticket price. And everybody who bought tickets from Ticketmaster got a $5 refund. Not much.
[37:17.520 --> 37:20.160]  Five bucks isn't much, but at least. Five bucks out of how much?
[37:21.200 --> 37:27.520]  30 or 40? I think mine was $30. But at least it was something, at least somebody standing up to
[37:27.520 --> 37:33.120]  Ticketmaster where I think now they're trying to enact a law that take this power away from
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.400]  But they'll stop spending even what they spend.
[38:10.400 --> 38:12.080]  Well, if you have a cap, then you have to have a four.
[38:13.360 --> 38:13.760]  You have to.
[38:14.400 --> 38:19.600]  So that for that reason, you know, if you have a luxury tax, you say, okay, there's also luxury
[38:19.600 --> 38:23.920]  tax if you don't spend this amount of money, you have to spend at least this much money.
[38:23.920 --> 38:26.480]  If you don't, then you're paying a luxury tax.
[38:26.480 --> 38:28.320]  Some of these teams just don't care.
[38:28.320 --> 38:30.560]  They don't have the money to spend, but they don't spend what they have.
[38:31.600 --> 38:34.080]  Well, that's why they're losing a heart.
[38:25.280 --> 38:31.840]  the marriage and just did it on his own. Oh, that's true. He beheaded Anne Boleyn, said she
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.640]  has sex with her brother, which she didn't, but you know, little things here and there, but I mean,
[38:36.640 --> 38:41.520]  the big things that they didn't take liberties on. I had a relative who was a sir in England,
[38:42.160 --> 38:46.320]  Sir Thomas Hinshaw. Isn't that when you got screwed out of the question? Sure did. Yeah,
[38:46.320 --> 38:50.880]  that would have been nice. Sure would have been. Someone from the court probably got him. Hey,
[37:33.120 --> 37:40.160]  Ticketmaster for charging that much for a process of a ticket online. That would help a lot.
[37:40.160 --> 37:45.680]  It really is stupid. I mean, basically you're purchasing a ticket online and they charge you
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.720]  30 bucks for that. Well, it's reasonable to pay for that service in some way, but just the price
[37:50.720 --> 37:55.040]  of it is outrageous. That's why if the fee was a couple bucks, you'd go, okay. That's why
[37:55.040 --> 38:01.200]  Airbnb's now are like $200 for cleaning fees and they expect you to also clean and like do things
[38:50.880 --> 38:55.120]  you guys are a wild boar. That's from Calcify the Ear. Well, that's, you know, you take away.
[38:55.120 --> 39:00.160]  Doug, have you seen the Napoleon film, the new Napoleon film? No. Seems right up your alley.
[39:00.160 --> 39:05.520]  Big historical war epic like that. I wouldn't mind seeing that. I saw somewhere where people
[39:05.520 --> 39:10.960]  didn't think it was very good. I saw it and it was not, but it's not good. It's doing too much.
[39:10.960 --> 39:15.840]  Napoleon is such an important figure and you're trying to cover his entire life in two and a half
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.440]  If you're the Pirates or the Royals or the situation the A's were in, and you can't get,
[38:39.440 --> 38:43.600]  but nine or 10,000 fans to some of your games, because you're hopelessly out of it,
[38:43.600 --> 38:46.400]  because you have no chance because your talent doesn't measure up,
[38:46.400 --> 38:47.840]  how much more money you got to spend?
[38:48.800 --> 38:50.720]  Outside of like a total overhaul.
[38:50.720 --> 38:52.160]  Yeah, how much you got to get to spend.
[38:52.160 --> 38:55.840]  Your TV ratings fall apart, so your TV deal is not worth very much.
[38:55.840 --> 38:57.520]  You're not getting a whole lot of the gate.
[38:57.520 --> 38:59.520]  You can't compete for these guys.
[38:59.520 --> 39:00.320]  You moved to Vegas.
[39:00.320 --> 39:00.960]  That's what you do.
[39:00.960 --> 39:02.560]  I guess you try to start somewhere else.
[38:01.200 --> 38:06.480]  just as a standard non-cleaning fee, but then they'll add the fee regardless if you clean or not.
[38:06.480 --> 38:10.560]  So they want you to take out the trash, get the laundry, like all in the laundry room,
[38:10.560 --> 38:13.840]  but then you're also paying the fee to clean, whether you do that or not.
[38:14.560 --> 38:18.560]  Really? So why do it? I am pranked out of Airbnb's. I don't do them anymore.
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.480]  We do hotels and we can't. I can't do Airbnb's no more.
[38:22.480 --> 38:25.120]  You're posting on Facebook. Sorry, Paul. Oh, you're good.
[38:25.920 --> 38:28.800]  What are you posting? Oh, no. Mid-show.
[39:15.840 --> 39:23.120]  hours. Impossible. The guy have his hand in his, in his pocket. Yeah. And they're trying to talk
[39:23.120 --> 39:28.000]  about like his marriage and his relationship with his wife and also his battle strategy. It's,
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.040]  it's trying to do two things at once. It's both too long and too short. It's, it's, I think it's
[39:33.040 --> 39:37.600]  worth seeing. It's too long and too short. Too long in the sense that like it's two and a half
[39:37.600 --> 39:40.880]  hours and eventually it gets to a point where you're like, okay, like what are we doing?
[39:02.560 --> 39:06.080]  More than people will show you, well, the Marlins won two World Series
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.440]  without spending a lot of money, and teams have spent a ton of money.
[39:09.440 --> 39:10.640]  San Diego, Dodgers.
[39:11.520 --> 39:12.400]  What did they do last year?
[39:12.400 --> 39:13.200]  That's...
[39:13.200 --> 39:14.320]  Did they win a World Series?
[39:14.320 --> 39:16.800]  Did they make it to the NLCS, the DS?
[39:17.920 --> 39:19.600]  They'll throw those figures out, Dad.
[39:19.600 --> 39:24.320]  You can say, it doesn't matter, because you can spend all the money in the world
[39:24.320 --> 39:24.960]  and not win.
[39:24.960 --> 39:27.040]  You can spend very little money and win.
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.920]  The Rangers spent a half a billion and won.
[39:29.920 --> 39:30.400]  Yeah.
[39:30.400 --> 39:31.360]  There's not too many that spend nothing.
[38:29.520 --> 38:33.680]  Leather, what are you posting? I'm just thanking Christopher Bondo for...
[38:34.640 --> 38:37.040]  Someone said, someone just texted him that you were posting on Facebook.
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.040]  I think I said, thanks, Hubbard. Congrats on 100 years.
[38:41.040 --> 38:45.040]  Oh, yeah. You took a picture of the, uh, 19 minutes ago.
[38:45.040 --> 38:48.720]  Hubbard's 100 year anniversary. Oh, that thing's heavy. You pick that thing up?
[38:48.720 --> 38:53.920]  Yeah, it is. Well, uh, Robert Smith's greatest performance is on South Park. It's from Mrs.
[39:40.960 --> 39:45.520]  Wrap it up. But also, nowadays two and a half, two and a half. No, no, no, no, no.
[39:46.880 --> 39:50.720]  Buck 20 is always going to be the average. Two hours on the dot. That doesn't seem very long.
[39:50.720 --> 39:54.800]  It's going to always going to be the average. Really? Two hours? Well, you said a buck 20.
[39:54.800 --> 39:59.600]  That didn't seem very long to me. Two hours seems more like it, maybe. A buck 20 minutes.
[39:59.600 --> 40:04.240]  A buck 20 is two hours. I thought you meant an hour and 20 minutes. No, no, I apologize. That's
[40:04.240 --> 40:09.120]  my fault. 120 minutes. So yeah, about two hours, about standard. Okay. But 90 minutes. That's what
[38:53.920 --> 38:57.920]  Jenny Shanahan. He's pretty good at running back at Ohio State.
[38:57.920 --> 39:01.120]  Put running back? Yeah. No college football analyst.
[39:02.080 --> 39:03.520]  Uh-huh. I don't know that.
[39:04.800 --> 39:07.360]  Yeah, it was good. He was one of the best in the country. Yeah, he was.
[39:08.320 --> 39:13.600]  All these crazy alien stories can't be true, can they? Hey, Stephen Deener hosted the Unidentified
[39:13.600 --> 39:17.360]  Alien podcast. And whether you're new to the conversation or have been looking into it for
[39:17.360 --> 39:21.920]  years, you need to check out the fastest growing alien show out there, the Unidentified Alien
[39:31.520 --> 39:32.800]  There's not too many that spend nothing and win.
[39:32.800 --> 39:35.600]  Even when the Marlins won, they had to ditch those players.
[39:35.600 --> 39:35.840]  Right.
[39:35.840 --> 39:36.640]  They had a bunch of young guys.
[39:36.640 --> 39:37.760]  Because they couldn't afford them anymore.
[39:37.760 --> 39:40.320]  Well, yeah, but they won when they weren't paying a lot of money.
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.000]  Now, when these guys knew they were going to ask for big contracts or arbitration,
[39:44.000 --> 39:44.720]  they were gone.
[39:44.720 --> 39:44.880]  Yeah.
[39:44.880 --> 39:45.600]  Look at the Rays.
[39:45.600 --> 39:50.160]  The Rays were two in the World Series, and they had a bunch of young guys
[39:50.160 --> 39:53.200]  before they pay them, and now all those young guys have gone elsewhere.
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.000]  Well, if you're going to do that, you better have the best scouts in the world
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.320]  and some darn good coaches along the mind of the league level
[39:58.320 --> 39:59.840]  to develop your own players.
[39:21.920 --> 39:26.480]  podcast, or UAP for short. There's a crazy amount of alien encounter stories out there
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.320]  from all over the world. And the beauty of it is that I bring them all to you and that
[39:30.320 --> 39:35.360]  you decide what you believe. Download and subscribe to UAP on any of the major podcasting platforms.
[39:35.360 --> 39:40.720]  And you can also find it on UAPpodcast.com. Well, we'll be talking football coming up in
[39:40.720 --> 39:46.640]  the next segment as Lisa Ann will join us on the other side of the break. Uh, before we go to break
[40:09.120 --> 40:13.600]  that, I mean, every studio would love if every movie was 90 minutes, gets more people in the door
[40:13.600 --> 40:17.520]  and you get more showings. You get a lot more showings at a theater if your movie's 90 minutes
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.480]  as opposed to 200 minutes. Was Joaquin Phoenix any good, Nick? Because he's, except for when he
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.760]  was dating the phone, he's pretty good in almost everything he's done. First of all, hers in the
[40:27.760 --> 40:33.120]  fantastic film. He's, yeah, he's weird in it. He's weird. I don't think he's actually all that good,
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.080]  but that's my opinion. I think people, he gets screwed and I want to be for Johnny Cash.
[39:59.840 --> 40:04.560]  The only giveaway information I could find was the bobblehead giveaway for every team,
[40:04.560 --> 40:08.720]  and the Cardinals had seven bobblehead giveaways, and that closest team was three.
[40:09.520 --> 40:16.080]  So we lead by a handsome margin this past season and bobblehead giveaways.
[40:16.080 --> 40:17.120]  More than twice.
[40:17.120 --> 40:18.000]  More than twice.
[40:18.000 --> 40:18.880]  The number of bobbleheads.
[40:18.880 --> 40:19.440]  That's just bobbleheads.
[40:19.440 --> 40:20.640]  We're our nearest competitor.
[40:20.640 --> 40:22.800]  But we're the best fans in baseball, so it makes sense.
[40:22.800 --> 40:22.960]  Yeah.
[40:22.960 --> 40:27.200]  I couldn't find the entire promotions for each team and break it down,
[40:27.200 --> 40:28.800]  but I did find the bobblehead giveaway.
[40:38.640 --> 40:43.760]  Who won that? Yeah, because I remember that video, that movie was amazing. Napoleon does look really
[40:43.760 --> 40:50.960]  good. I know my girl, Jane Polly Sunday morning did a special with, I forgot who the director of
[40:50.960 --> 40:56.160]  that was. Napoleon. They've worked. Ridley Scott. Okay. So they were, him and Joaquin worked together
[40:56.160 --> 41:01.760]  in the past. I'm glad to hear. Yeah. So they talk about the movie. It looks really good. Looks very
[39:46.640 --> 39:52.640]  plow. Oh, I'm sorry, Doug. A good gift for your dog this year is naturals. Naturals. Yeah, I agree.
[39:52.640 --> 39:56.400]  I agree. It's a good gift. Perfect holiday gift. Give me all those bones, I mean. Yes,
[39:56.400 --> 40:02.240]  you can have a bone. Here's a bone. Here. Well, use a fierce spot. Now I'm going to throw it to you.
[40:02.240 --> 40:07.040]  Here, I want you to have the bone. There. Nice hands. There was an $8 fee with that. Catch with
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.440]  the body, baby. There are no additional tack-on fees at naturals. They're my present for Cammie.
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.840]  Because they want your dog to be happy, and they will be happy if they try some of these naturals.
[40:28.800 --> 40:30.480]  No team has it out yet except for the Cardinals.
[40:30.480 --> 40:32.400]  The Cardinals already have their 2024 promotions out.
[40:32.400 --> 40:33.920]  No, but I'm talking this is last year.
[40:33.920 --> 40:37.360]  These were 2023 seasons, so what we did last year.
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.320]  Well, Pausey, when we get a little lull in the action here,
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.000]  go to 2024 cardinal giveaways.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.040]  They're already out.
[40:43.040 --> 40:43.520]  I did see-
[40:43.520 --> 40:44.480]  Unless you read some of them.
[40:45.040 --> 40:48.400]  I think Wayno and his dog is one of them, I think.
[40:49.120 --> 40:52.480]  We had a bobblehead collection last year where he had to go three times to get them
[40:52.480 --> 40:53.680]  because they connected together.
[40:53.680 --> 40:54.720]  Match that, Dodgers.
[40:54.720 --> 40:58.400]  And then they re- and people resold those for $350.
[41:01.760 --> 41:08.960]  well shot. Good and glad to hear. Just cinematic masterpiece. Always stop it. It's a film, right?
[41:08.960 --> 41:13.680]  It's not just a movie. It's a film. I call it a picture. Yeah, the picture one. It gets me every
[41:13.680 --> 41:19.920]  time. Stop it. Napoleon doing doggy was nice though. Yeah, there is a moment in that where there's some
[41:19.920 --> 41:26.240]  somewhat graphic sex scene in that one. You guys did a bang up job once again. Enjoy your vacation.
[41:26.240 --> 41:29.680]  That comes from Neil Allen, Craig Paquet. Oh, thank you, Neil. Thank you, Neil. Former,
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.160]  Naturals is a locally owned family business founded by two dedicated TMA listeners who
[40:20.160 --> 40:24.800]  want to provide your dog with top quality dog treats. They carry a lineup of limited ingredient
[40:24.800 --> 40:31.040]  dental chews, 100 percent rawhide free options, and mouth-watering oven-baked cookies. Doesn't
[40:31.040 --> 40:34.880]  that sound good? Your dog will think it's good. They'll be wagging their tail with excitement
[40:34.880 --> 40:39.520]  after tasting flavors like real peanut butter, chicken, and pumpkin. Your dog's going to be
[40:39.520 --> 40:43.120]  begging for more just like my dog Dora absolutely loves these. These are the ones she loves, these
[40:58.400 --> 41:00.960]  They were selling them for $350 or $400.
[41:00.960 --> 41:01.680]  Almost $800.
[41:01.680 --> 41:03.120]  $800, Pausey, some were going far.
[41:03.120 --> 41:03.760]  For the group?
[41:03.760 --> 41:04.480]  Oh, my God.
[41:05.760 --> 41:06.880]  I didn't get those.
[41:09.760 --> 41:12.960]  The Rams did that once, Doug, where you had to go to two separate games.
[41:12.960 --> 41:15.840]  You could get the Jake Long offensive line one,
[41:15.840 --> 41:17.760]  and you get the Chris Long, the relation.
[41:18.320 --> 41:21.280]  Opposite side and my dumb ass went and both games
[41:21.280 --> 41:23.440]  because I wanted to get them and connect them together
[41:23.440 --> 41:25.280]  so they could line up across from each other.
[41:30.080 --> 41:36.080]  fan page moderator. Yeah. He was a little vile himself. Oh, I love Neil. Yeah. Before we get
[41:36.080 --> 41:40.000]  to our design air heating cooling email of the day, we got to tell you about Andrea's and their
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.080]  delicious barbecue sauce, steak sauce, and salad dressing. Paul, can I hear a little about Andrea's?
[41:44.080 --> 41:52.160]  Check out Andrea's barbecue sauce. I am in love with it. And right now at Shnooks, there is a

[42:00.560 --> 42:07.760]  discount of the year with 70 cents off each steak sauce from Andrea's and a dollar off each barbecue
[42:07.760 --> 42:13.680]  sauce and a dollar off each salad dressing. In December, Dearberg's is going to be carrying
[42:13.680 --> 42:19.920]  an exclusive three pack gift set featuring all three of Andrea's products. And the history of
[41:25.280 --> 41:29.520]  I got the I got the Pujols one, but I don't have the other two to connect it to.
[41:29.520 --> 41:33.200]  So the Pujols bobblehead just sits there with a connecting piece that's going nowhere.
[41:33.200 --> 41:35.440]  Well, get your credit card ready.
[41:35.440 --> 41:36.160]  I got an eBay.
[41:36.160 --> 41:36.960]  Because you got an eBay.
[41:36.960 --> 41:38.000]  70 bucks, baby.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.400]  eBay, they're shipping from Festus.
[41:41.600 --> 41:43.680]  And when you walk out of the stadium with your bobblehead,
[41:43.680 --> 41:45.360]  there's guys here already wanting to buy it.
[41:45.360 --> 41:47.440]  And I always think, why don't I just take the money now
[41:47.440 --> 41:49.600]  because they're just going to sit in my basement and do nothing?
[41:51.280 --> 41:52.640]  Why don't I just say, sure, here.
[42:19.920 --> 42:28.320]  Andrea's is featured on the back. They're celebrating 45 years of business this month
[42:28.320 --> 42:35.520]  at Andrea's. Andrea's steakhouse and Andrea's barbecue sauce, salad dressing, and the famous
[42:35.520 --> 42:42.000]  steak sauce online at Andrea's.com. And now a big sale at Shnooks. Tim does a little ASMR there.
[41:08.720 --> 41:14.320]  Naturals.com. Shop local this holiday season, support the local sponsors, support your fellow
[41:14.320 --> 41:20.240]  TMA listeners with a gift for your dog from Naturals. That's Naturals, and we have the Design Air
[41:20.240 --> 41:24.400]  Heating and Cooling email of the day on the other side of the break as well. In addition to Lisa Ann,
[41:24.400 --> 41:29.040]  who'll be joining via the phone lines, Paul, can I hear about our HVAC provider that's Design Air
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.320]  Heating and Cooling? Design Air Heating and Cooling is the official HVAC provider of TMA and the Tim
[41:34.320 --> 41:40.880]  McKernan Show podcast. They're online at designairservice.com. And yeah, I know it's warm right
[41:40.880 --> 41:47.120]  now, but it's inevitably going to cool down and your furnace is going to be working over time. So
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.440]  when that happens, you want to make sure it's working. Seth Goldkamp of Design Air Heating and
[41:51.440 --> 42:01.840]  Cooling says, get that furnace tuned up and do so very easily, very quickly by going to designairservice.com
[41:53.440 --> 41:55.600]  I'll give you give me the 15 bucks for it.
[41:56.400 --> 41:58.000]  They don't think I don't do anything with them.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.960]  They don't think I'm lying because I don't have to go every game anymore.
[42:02.160 --> 42:03.200]  I just got a guy.
[42:03.200 --> 42:04.720]  You have you have soldiers.
[42:04.720 --> 42:06.560]  No, I have got an inside guy.
[42:06.560 --> 42:09.360]  No, one of the guys that there knows that I use them for charity.
[42:09.360 --> 42:11.200]  So he says, yeah, does that put him in a bag for you?
[42:11.200 --> 42:12.640]  Just, you know, when you come, let me know.
[42:12.640 --> 42:14.080]  Save save the ones you missed.
[42:15.120 --> 42:18.160]  But when I used to have to go, you know, weekends and pick up the stuff
[42:18.800 --> 42:20.080]  and leave in the second inning.
[42:20.080 --> 42:21.040]  Always big guy out there.
[42:42.000 --> 42:52.080]  You like that? Yeah. Andrea's? No, it's Shnooks. That's ASMR. It's kind of a low talking whisper.
[42:52.080 --> 42:55.840]  Sounds like it's coming from your esophagus. Yeah, it's kind of an ASMR thing Tim's doing there.

[42:23.360 --> 42:24.720]  I say the same thing as for charity.
[42:25.520 --> 42:26.560]  And they just never believe me.
[42:27.120 --> 42:27.520]  Sure.
[42:27.520 --> 42:28.000]  F off.
[42:28.560 --> 42:30.080]  They don't say say that to you.
[42:30.080 --> 42:30.640]  They do.
[42:30.640 --> 42:32.800]  Not all of them, but they ignore me.
[42:32.800 --> 42:34.800]  Some I get charity F off.
[42:35.360 --> 42:37.040]  So now it really is for charity.
[42:37.040 --> 42:38.080]  I not selling it.
[42:38.640 --> 42:41.680]  Hey, Jackson, I know you're a big New Jersey Devils guy.
[42:41.680 --> 42:45.520]  Didn't they try a long term contract with Ilya Kovalchuk?
[42:45.520 --> 42:46.320]  Nailed that.
[42:46.320 --> 42:46.480]  Yeah.
[42:47.360 --> 42:49.040]  That was overturned and they were fined.
[42:49.040 --> 42:49.360]  Thanks.
[42:30.960 --> 42:34.320]  That's Design Air. All right, coming up on the other side of the break, we'll have Lisa Ann
[42:34.320 --> 42:39.360]  sending your two-part questions to the EDF Group Text inbox at 314-881-TMA5, and then we'll have
[42:39.360 --> 42:44.240]  the Design Air Heating and Cooling email today. And then that will be TMA for 2023. And we'll be
[42:44.240 --> 42:51.680]  back on January the 2nd, that's a Tuesday, because New Year's Day is the first on Monday. So we'll
[42:51.680 --> 42:58.640]  be back on Tuesday the 2nd. One more segment to go, baby, for 2023. We'll be coming back with Lisa
[43:34.560 --> 43:38.720]  Bull Eligible. Thank you to the listeners, the people who support our sponsors, come out to our
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.160]  events, always contributing to the program. You guys are the reason that we get to do this dumbass
[43:44.160 --> 43:48.880]  job and we very much appreciate you. And that is a perfect way to segue into our design air heating
[43:48.880 --> 43:56.240]  and cooling email of the day. Listen, I come in peace. But the absolute apex of today's show is
[43:56.240 --> 44:01.280]  when Iggy and his perpetual pout during the weekly Friday, Lisa and segment pretended to read for
[42:58.640 --> 43:01.840]  Ann on the other side of the break. This is the Morning After presented by Brown Group and Live
[43:01.840 --> 43:15.840]  from the M
Transcribed and uploaded: 12-22-23_Segment_2_When_You_Walk_Into_A_Building,_Sex_Is_In_Town.json
[42:49.840 --> 42:51.200]  That's from Kucky the dwarf.
[42:51.840 --> 42:53.920]  I'll defer that to our hockey analyst.
[42:53.920 --> 42:55.040]  His name is Doug Vaughn.
[42:56.240 --> 42:56.400]  Yeah.
[42:56.400 --> 42:57.680]  Well, that was the case.
[42:57.680 --> 42:59.360]  And it was an interesting case.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.440]  And you really ought to do yourself a favor and read into that someday.
[43:03.440 --> 43:03.760]  Yeah.
[43:03.760 --> 43:05.200]  To get the get the ends announced.
[43:05.200 --> 43:07.440]  I could go into it in exhausting detail now.
[43:07.440 --> 43:08.160]  It's fascinating.
[43:08.160 --> 43:09.760]  But I don't want it is fascinating.
[43:09.760 --> 43:14.160]  The worst tampering of the worst ever ever done is what it was.
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.160]  But also remember, Chris Paul trade to the Laker.
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.920]  the better part of 20 minutes. Not realizing that the book was upside down made all the better.
[44:05.920 --> 44:10.480]  When he looked his nicotine, nicotine stained fingers to turn the page, watching him all go
[44:10.480 --> 44:15.520]  all Daniel Day Lewis and really dig into his role as guy who reads intently was inspiration to us all
[44:15.520 --> 44:19.920]  shaming. Didn't get part that part in the movie. He didn't apply for happy holidays. If young pop,
[44:19.920 --> 44:25.360]  pop, don't trust you. I'm a gapia. Oh, young pop pop. There's the book I was reading and it wasn't
[44:25.360 --> 44:29.920]  upside down. Why are you reading that? I was looking at the pictures during the at least
[43:18.160 --> 43:19.280]  That was no fun.
[43:19.280 --> 43:20.320]  David Stern.
[43:20.320 --> 43:25.680]  That was the worst of the at the time had ownership of the then New Orleans Hornets.
[43:25.680 --> 43:28.960]  Like that's insane to me that yeah, that was an odd one.
[43:28.960 --> 43:30.960]  Such a conflict of interest.
[43:30.960 --> 43:31.920]  I'm good on hate tech.
[43:31.920 --> 43:33.040]  So I'll move on past that.
[43:33.040 --> 43:33.600]  But you're right.
[43:33.600 --> 43:34.080]  Black Hawk.
[43:34.080 --> 43:35.200]  You're right on here.
[43:35.200 --> 43:41.920]  We go again with Ken dispensing unchecked numbers that some AI fembot sent to his Instagram inbox.
[43:41.920 --> 43:43.280]  Dodgers tickets are $800.
[43:43.920 --> 43:44.720]  Seriously.
[43:44.720 --> 43:46.400]  You're having another aneurysm bacon.
[43:46.400 --> 43:47.520]  That's from little Tommy.
[44:29.920 --> 44:36.960]  the end segment. I have no interest in it. In the segment? Yeah, I don't. Why not? I'm not
[44:36.960 --> 44:42.640]  interested in anything she does. Oh, well, that's not a very nice thing to say about one of our
[44:42.640 --> 44:51.840]  guests. She's done now. So I'm there. Passionately kiss Doug, lay him on his back, lube, insert,
[44:51.840 --> 44:58.320]  smack, smack, smack. That comes from potty mouth. That's awful. Potty mouth with a very poor email.
[43:48.080 --> 43:49.680]  I believe somebody read that.
[43:49.680 --> 43:51.120]  I think KG Redditor Plows.
[43:51.120 --> 43:54.560]  He read what it was for opening day is what I was talking about.
[43:54.560 --> 43:55.840]  And I think I was pretty close.
[43:56.880 --> 43:58.560]  You were right on on the number.
[43:58.560 --> 44:02.480]  Guys, almost every year there is a Cinderella type team that doesn't have a big payroll that makes
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.240]  a run to the World Series as the reason the majority of teams don't spend living on the
[44:06.240 --> 44:09.120]  hope that they can go on the heater at the right time and make a good run.
[44:09.120 --> 44:10.720]  That comes from Scott's wrinkled ball sack.
[44:10.720 --> 44:13.520]  And I think that is a very poignant text.
[44:58.320 --> 45:02.800]  Very poor indeed. He ever had one run for it. Potty mouth? Probably shouldn't have any more red
[45:02.800 --> 45:08.080]  after that. Yeah. Well, you guys might spend like Tim Lee's for a few days in the show. Absolutely
[45:08.080 --> 45:13.200]  flies off the rails. Yesterday, Darren legitimately asked what's God's last name. It's God Christ,
[45:13.200 --> 45:17.920]  right? Now Ken is rambling on about something called the Jewish company and Gerber baby food.
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.320]  This show needs to get back to its roots. TMA was great because you guys used to discuss french fries
[45:22.320 --> 45:27.600]  and bracketology. Now your show is one long plugola hijack about Iggy's cameo in the Springfield
[44:13.600 --> 44:20.080]  I think that's more reflection of the MLB playoff system and the way it works now where you kind of
[44:20.960 --> 44:23.120]  if you get hot at the right time, I mean, that's always been the case.
[44:23.120 --> 44:27.120]  But especially with pitching, you can get pitching to click at the right time.
[44:27.120 --> 44:32.640]  And it's just not worth the risk for a team like the Cardinals to increase their payroll to 300
[44:32.640 --> 44:34.240]  million from 200 million.
[44:34.240 --> 44:36.640]  You might still finish it forth and not make the playoffs.
[44:36.640 --> 44:38.640]  And now you've lost $100 million.
[44:38.640 --> 44:40.080]  No business wants to do that.
[44:40.080 --> 44:43.200]  You know, who's slowly probably losing a fan favorite?
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.320]  sports hall of fame. In the old days, Doug would constantly proposition by married men hoping to
[45:32.320 --> 45:38.000]  hook up with cam O V's hot, hunkiest heartthrob. For some reason, the playful sexual harassment
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.800]  has totally disappeared. I'll refer you to that last email. I want to bring it back. Who was the
[45:42.800 --> 45:46.880]  first person with the last name? How should I know? I've got bigger fish to fry. I've been thinking
[45:46.880 --> 45:51.840]  about a hot little 25 year old dude with an invisible mustache. There's a line in the old
[45:51.840 --> 45:56.720]  Christmas song bouncing around my brain, something about make the Yuletide gay. Well, I want to be
[45:56.720 --> 46:02.320]  the Yuletide with Jackson so bad. I want to rip off his sleepless in Seattle PJs and say hello
[46:02.320 --> 46:08.080]  to his girthy Yule log. No, I want to spread my sour cream on his potato pancakes. Jackson is
[46:08.080 --> 46:13.760]  going to need extra strength preparation age when I'm done tearing up his pale dumper. Oh gosh. Merry
[46:13.760 --> 46:18.400]  Christmas. You filthy animals. Thanks for another great year. That comes from the JV golf coach PS
[46:18.400 --> 46:26.000]  ILL by 25 tonight. You didn't have to read that JV golf coach didn't have to wanted to. It was vile.
[46:26.000 --> 46:32.080]  Didn't have to. I wanted. Okay. So you, you're encouraging people to hit on you. Listen, man,
[46:32.080 --> 46:39.360]  gentlemen, I'm a man and I have an ego and sometimes I need that ego stroked by gentlemen,
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.760]  gentlemen, ladies. I don't care. You don't think shame. Okay. I know a guy down at the stadium
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.120]  who gets me free bobbleheads because he knows they're going to charity. I used to have to go
[46:49.120 --> 46:52.800]  down there each game and pretend to be a media member to get the bobbleheads. And when I'd walk
[46:52.800 --> 46:56.320]  out in the second inning, there'd be a guy outside who would offer me 20 bucks for him. I'd always
[46:56.320 --> 46:59.680]  tell him these are for charity. And he replied, yeah, right. I saw you hock and bobbleheads on
[46:59.680 --> 47:04.640]  Facebook marketplace. I just want to echo all the positive talk about the new Skelly. I enjoyed
[47:04.640 --> 47:08.160]  listening to the segment that played this morning where Iggy was talking about how he was gifted a
[47:08.160 --> 47:12.480]  Mac book pro. And during the same segment, the idea of Jackson joining for that day's pepper and
[47:12.480 --> 47:17.600]  genie was being discussed, meaning this had to be in 2022. Iggy has been sitting on a free Mac book
[47:17.600 --> 47:21.760]  pro for over a year without using it. I'm not sure how Jackson is supposed to download Apple and
[47:21.760 --> 47:26.240]  Iggy never brings it into work. My best guess is that Iggy will wait for his current masturbation
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.120]  station to crash before bothering to set up the lab top, meaning it's just a matter of time before
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.080]  Jackson gets an emergency tech support call from a blue ball to Iggy demanding he help up his Apple
[47:36.080 --> 47:43.200]  ID so he can get back to admiring the lady boys at X and XX.com. At this point, Iggy will regret
[47:43.200 --> 47:48.720]  having given away all his playboys and signs of rubbing one out while chatting with GG Oak Forest
[47:48.720 --> 47:54.240]  that comes from Buck Swope. Buck Swope with a nice little email this morning. And fellas,
[47:54.240 --> 48:00.560]  that's what we got for the design there. I love it. Not a very, not a lot of volume here in the
[48:00.560 --> 48:03.840]  last, I guess, because Buck Swope already wrapped it up. People don't feel that sense of competition.
[48:03.840 --> 48:09.920]  Potty mouth is clearly out and JB golf coach got unusually vile. Young Pop Pop was so,
[48:09.920 --> 48:15.440]  I'm going to have to give it to Buck Swope again. Eggs? What was Potty Mouse again? You want me to
[44:43.520 --> 44:54.480]  I
[44:54.480 --> 45:00.960]  lot of like cryptic like pictures and videos of them like having like giving
[45:00.960 --> 45:05.280]  off the impression that that was going to be a possibility even though he may
[45:05.280 --> 45:10.640]  not have even thought that but the fans of this team definitely thought that and
[45:10.640 --> 45:16.080]  so maybe fans are a little ticked that will his newt barding get over the top
[45:16.080 --> 45:21.280]  you know I want to defend John Lozaylen for a second here only from a poster on
[48:15.440 --> 48:19.360]  read it again? It was horrible, short and terrible. Oh, good. Then I'll give it to Potty
[48:19.360 --> 48:24.560]  Mouth. I'm going JV golf coach. So, Plowsey, the onus is on you. We'll give it to Potty Mouse and
[48:24.560 --> 48:30.240]  Doug hates it. Yeah, Lucas. I'm going to get you around that. Potty Mouth has earned themselves a
[48:30.240 --> 48:36.800]  victory here on the, I think it's great that on the last email today of 2023, someone named Potty
[48:36.800 --> 48:42.320]  Mouth who sent in, it was one of the worst emails we've ever had in the whole year. You can have no
[45:21.280 --> 45:27.600]  Facebook well I'll mention his name what mention his name drag his ass I'm not
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.640]  gonna do that he posts like every five seconds I'm almost to the point where I
[45:32.640 --> 45:37.680]  have to block him because he posts so much blocking that's the only reason
[45:37.680 --> 45:45.640]  because he blocks he posts too much but he did is some st. Louis guy mr. talking
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.600]  punctuation in that. I still don't think it's a complete sentence, but they've won the design,
[48:45.600 --> 48:49.600]  air heating and cooling email today. Read it again, just so our listeners can hear what a
[48:49.600 --> 48:54.720]  horrible choice it was to give this guy anything. Passionately kiss Doug, lay him on his back,
[48:54.720 --> 48:59.280]  loop and insert. Smack, smack, smack. That came from Potty Mouth. That's what they voted for.
[48:59.280 --> 49:02.560]  It's like a haiku. That's what you voted for. It was short. It was like eight words and that's
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.640]  perfect because they all sucked. Eight stupid words. So, I just gave it to the shortest one that
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.480]  sucked the shortest. I actually didn't know what it said. That was the first time I would have
[45:45.640 --> 45:53.680]  baseball or something and he reposted this article this guy wrote that Matt
[45:53.680 --> 45:58.840]  carpenter is available and the reasons maybe the Cardinals should go get him and
[45:58.840 --> 46:04.120]  then the guy who posts all the time had a comment with the repost and he started
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.880]  naming guys you know just hey look who I know I know Ben Hockman I know start
[46:08.880 --> 46:14.320]  tagging these people and said get down there and talk to Mosaylak he's losing
[49:10.480 --> 49:15.040]  voted for it for sure. You would have. It was terrible. Now I'm confident that would have voted
[49:15.040 --> 49:18.640]  for that. Oh, the loomster's upset that his email didn't get read. I didn't see it. Well, read it.
[49:18.640 --> 49:22.240]  Maybe we can get a better winner. Hey, fellas, any chance we can wrap this up so I can listen to
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.400]  the skeleton? Thanks. That's from the loomster. Okay, I'll vote for the loomster. Sorry. Potty
[49:26.400 --> 49:32.800]  Mouth's already taking control. And so, this first segment after this is Collars Making Cases for
[49:32.800 --> 49:39.040]  their Listener of the Year award and then Sweet, Sweet Kai Story. Nice. Oh, probably about his
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.640]  it don't let him do this he's losing it I said I just respond where in the
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.960]  article was John was a like quoted as he's going after Matt carpenter you're
[46:22.960 --> 46:26.720]  going after John Mosaylak and he eats he's not even in the article he didn't
[46:26.720 --> 46:30.600]  say was going after carpenter that's just some wannabe writer from some
[46:30.600 --> 46:34.600]  message board so you held his feet to the far I did I said quit posting this
[46:34.600 --> 46:38.000]  stuff and then tagging all these people like hey everybody look who I know I'm
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.640]  tagging him you don't know him you follow him but he gets blamed for so
[46:43.640 --> 46:47.480]  much but he gets blamed for an article that's talking about would carpenter be
[46:47.480 --> 46:53.400]  a good fit in st. Louis again please go down there and stop him he's losing his
[46:53.400 --> 46:58.200]  mind he had nothing to do with this article he wasn't quoted he didn't say
[46:58.200 --> 47:02.040]  yeah we're interested we're gonna go look at him so I just like to defend
[47:02.040 --> 47:06.000]  Mosaylak he gets enough crap so well I don't expect he wears too much about
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.560]  being blamed for things by the nitwit portion of the family no but this guy
[49:39.040 --> 49:43.440]  girlfriend being propositioned. Yeah. The lesbianic moment. Back to backers. Thank you, gentlemen,
[49:43.440 --> 49:47.120]  for a year of blessings and Jackson. You killed these past two days. Merry Christmas, you dirty
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.080]  boys, and I'll see you all in the new year. That's from Pounce Lanani. Have we seen you at all?

[48:34.280 --> 48:39.080]  sent in a screenshot of what looks to be some sort of proposal for the program I'm
[48:39.080 --> 48:44.200]  gonna read it okay I'm gonna come pretty funny I'm gonna propose an idea that
[48:44.200 --> 48:48.120]  helps everyone it's called Ken on the tens every 10 minutes starting at 710
[48:48.120 --> 48:51.880]  Ken gets to Ken it up for 90 seconds talk about whatever you want

[51:06.960 --> 51:10.880]  things. It's just really nice to have him part of the team. On days where, you know, like these,
[51:10.880 --> 51:15.360]  where I would usually be doing multiple things and sweating, running around back and forth to
[51:15.360 --> 51:20.480]  have KG back there so I can trust back there is very important. Doug, now when you say TMA,
[51:20.480 --> 51:25.680]  your first thought is what? Tim McCurden and Associates. And then KG and Otown next. He's
[51:25.680 --> 51:29.520]  one of the associates, I'm happy to be an associate. Not Kurt Warner, but Kurt Gardner.
[48:56.360 --> 48:59.560]  head and says something supporting statements like yeah man that's awesome
[48:59.560 --> 49:04.400]  or that's crazy and then it'll end with Doug saying huh after a long pause and
[49:04.400 --> 49:07.600]  who's dance can move on but he has to knock Ken it up the rest of the time
[49:07.600 --> 49:11.240]  he's welcome to check emails and videos on his phone Ken on the tens think about
[49:11.240 --> 49:16.280]  it oh that came from the bastard James Hahn would you be up for that Iggy no
[49:16.280 --> 49:19.680]  yeah I can check things on my phone but I had a laptop nobody would care because

[51:01.240 --> 51:05.080]  that thing yeah for sure you want to give it to me and see if I can get it
[51:05.080 --> 51:10.040]  going and maybe keep it if it does dog technology expert you don't know I don't

[51:19.040 --> 51:25.480]  like to design what computers and never uses it so I wouldn't use it here I
[51:25.480 --> 51:29.520]  don't do enough here to use it here I could pull it up the net way if I do
[51:29.520 --> 51:33.520]  stuff nobody's he's on the smart again I mean he's tired of the listeners caring
[51:33.520 --> 51:37.720]  about what I do during this program no you're tired but at home I have a desktop
[51:37.720 --> 51:42.320]  server they don't need it at home yeah I prefer a desktop to at home just easier

[51:50.000 --> 51:57.320]  I don't use down with viruses I haven't used the laptop yet any SMR videos but
[51:57.320 --> 52:00.280]  other than that I really don't spend a lot of time you have no other need for
[52:00.280 --> 52:05.520]  a computer lines are bored on that one other than porn and if I have to type
[52:05.520 --> 52:10.000]  something I don't want to type it on my phone if I have to if it's a long email
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.360]  I will do it on my desktop because I'd rather have a keyboard than trying to
[52:15.360 --> 52:20.960]  type a long email with little numbers on a phone right but if you buy something

[55:27.720 --> 55:32.480]  appreciate his work on the skeleton providing listeners with sweet best of
[55:32.480 --> 55:35.080]  some of their favorite segments that they can enjoy around the hearth though
[55:35.080 --> 55:39.120]  during the holiday season mm-hmm and that's how you listen you gather around
[55:39.120 --> 55:41.960]  the heart right the family listens together you don't just sit around the
[55:41.960 --> 55:45.720]  kitchen table or something you find a hearth somewhere you get the Victoria and
[55:45.720 --> 55:51.040]  you sit there and listen and before you get the keyboard out and feel like you
[55:51.040 --> 55:57.040]  need to send a DM you know maybe send an email maybe you're penning a letter
[55:57.160 --> 56:01.360]  about maybe hearing something four days prior than hearing it again let me tell
[56:01.360 --> 56:06.840]  you what what it's the holiday season you know you do realize how bad it looks
[56:06.840 --> 56:11.520]  on December 26th if you email somebody or message somebody about a skeleton

[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.360]  is this because you're not in it because you're so you're trying to downgrade it
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:58.920]  no I just said I've lost all respect for it as far as anybody just the entire
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.520]  award show and this is because Claiborne got in and didn't invite you no he didn't
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.720]  know he didn't I think

[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.520]  people down there Gerald Andrews has put together a great Hall of Fame down
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.080]  there is a lot of money really I'm just saying it's it's what kind of a Hall of
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.800]  Fame is when all these people go in when basically you're just putting in people
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.120]  that are gonna buy three or four or five tables it's kind of a joke of a Hall of
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.520]  Fame it's good at what they do to to raise money and but the people are
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.880]  putting in is because they know that they're gonna buy a bunch of tables it
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:43.600]  waters down the Hall of Fame itself that's all I'm saying gosh takes takes
